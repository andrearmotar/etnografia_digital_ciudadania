Add us_president:
Determine the US President in office based on the post's created_utc timestamp.
Use these rules:
If created_utc falls between January 20, 2021 (UTC timestamp 1611100800) and January 20, 2025 (UTC timestamp 1737398400), the president is "Joe Biden".
Otherwise, the president is "Donald Trump".
Add the key us_president with the determined name as its string value.
Add location:
Read the selftext and title to identify mentions of the poster's geographical location (country and, if available, state/city/region).
Add the key location.
If a location is found:
Assign an object {"country": "CountryName", "state": "StateName"} as the value.
If only the country is identifiable, use {"country": "CountryName", "state": null}.
Example: If the text mentions "Mexico City", use {"country": "Mexico", "state": "Mexico City"}. If it mentions only "Mexico", use {"country": "Mexico", "state": null}.
If no location information can be reasonably inferred from the post, assign null as the value for the location key.
Add sex:
Infer the likely sex of the post author by analyzing the selftext for contextual clues (e.g., "my wife", "my husband", "as a mother", pronouns if explicitly used in context).
Add the key sex.
Assign "Hombre" or "Mujer" as the string value if the sex can be reasonably inferred.
If the author's sex cannot be determined from the text, assign null as the value.
Add document:
Identify the specific official document(s) that are the main subject of discussion or inquiry in the title and selftext (e.g., "CRBA", "hospital birth certificate", "transcripts", "apostille", "birth certificate translation", "passport").
Add the key document.
Assign the name(s) of the identified document(s) as a string value. If multiple related documents are mentioned as the core topic, you can list them concisely (e.g., "CRBA / proof of physical presence").
If the post discusses the CRBA process generally without focusing on one specific document, or if no particular document is referenced, assign null as the value.
Output:
Return the complete, modified JSON array, where each original post object now includes the added us_president, location, sex, and document keys with their corresponding values determined according to the instructions above. The structure should match the final example JSON provided in our previous interactions.
