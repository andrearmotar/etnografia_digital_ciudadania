The child was born via IVF from donor sperm.\n\nAccording to several things I read, the child acquired US citizenship at birth.  For example, [this](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12-part-h-chapter-2) states:\n\n> To be considered a child of a U.S. citizen father, the child must be: ...  The child of a U.S. citizen father who is married to the child’s genetic or gestational parent at the time of the child’s birth (even if no genetic or gestational relationship exists with the U.S. citizen father) if both parents are recognized by the relevant jurisdiction as the child’s legal parents ...\n\nBut all the instructions for all the forms I have seen (e.g. N-600, CRBA, etc.) seem to require that the father be the biological father of the child.\n\n1) What is up with this?\n\n2) Assuming we can get past this, it seems a CRBA (if possible) would be much cheaper and quicker than a N-600.  We live in Texas but could easily travel to Mexico.  Is that allowed for the CRBA?\n\nTIA",

We lived in Mexico up until 2008.\n\nI’ll give a bit of background of my family history in the US:\n\nMy dad (43 years old) is a US citizen by birth, born in Del Rio, lived in Mexico until he was about 27 years old, moved in 2007 and worked for one year in San Antonio ,then we moved in with him after getting us green cards in 2008 (I was 7). He worked and lived with us in San Antonio for 5 more years, then my parents separated BUT NOT DIVORCED. My mom went back to Mexico, I went to live with my aunt in Eagle Pass whom I still stay with to this day, but he stayed in the US to work for 3-4 more years to provide before moving back to Mexico. So he was working a total of about 10 years in the US. I’m not sure if I was a beneficiary of anything or if there is anything written that he provided financial support to me until I was 18, he is on my birth certificate and we did live together and did provide for me until I was 18.\n\nIs this enough to get denied naturalization due to being able to get citizenship through my father?

We are at a crossroads currently, we need to make a choice of me going completely alone to the USA to give birth to guarantee citizenship or staying abroad with family, to later try to prove physical presence.\n\nI have some documents of me being raised there for the first three years of my life (mostly photos) and some pediatrician records plus vaccines. My parents were able to find some bills, obviously on their names as I was a baby.  \n  \nLater in my life, around my 20's, I lived in the USA for 3 years and some months but the only thing consistent in my name is my car registry (imported the car from Mexico which had always been on my name and continued to be on my name until I sold it in the USA, insurance payments, plus CarFax records). I lived with my parents, so all the bills are on their names.   \n  \nI have some W-2's, but I was never able to find full-time job, so it's usually on average three days a week payments or 39 hours a week. I do have passport stamps that record me staying in for long periods of time.\n\nI never went to the Doctor although I was assigned a PCP and everything, but I was terrified of going bankrupt in the American system, so I just drove down to Mexico and went for healthcare there when needed. So, no medical records.\n\nSo, in Summary I have:\n\n* Baby photos, medical pediatrician records and some bills on my parent's names (worth 3 years).\n* Bank Statements, with my name and address.\n* Car Registries and Insurance Payments with address.\n* Bills on my parent's names for water, electric and internet bills.\n* W-2's with part-time employment (three years).\n* Pet Records (vaccines, pet tax, etc).\n* Passport Stamps. I have all my passports, even when I was a baby, so this includes those stamps.\n* Four years of Tax Returns in which I paid taxes because I was living there at the time.\n* Realistically, I have around 5, maybe 6 years of proof.\n\n  \nWould that be enough? Are photos actually admissible (especially for toddlerhood?).   \nWhat uncommon documents do the accept? TIA!",

I filed out the application for CRBA online and choosed Mexico city as interview location, made the payment online. Few days later I received an email from U.S Embassy in Mexico city with interview appointment date scheduled in August(application was filled  in May), I tried to get earlier appointment but they told me that there is no earlier appointment that I can try to see if other consulate have opening , I checked the online system and we were lucky to find May 26 appointment at the U.S consulate in Merida.Scheduled another interview and asked Merida to request that Mexico city transferred our online application to Merida, they did and we went for the interview with all documents, officer at the interview told us that everything was fine and we request for an emergency passport for our daughter, the U.S passport was issued the same day, officer told us that our approved documents will be transferred to Mexico city for them to issue the CRBA since the online payment was made to them. In July I received email from U.S embassy in Mexico city asking for more proof of presence in the U.S, I sent 6 years of my credit card bills and also my bank statement as requested, few days later they contacted me and ask for more proof like travel history, I sent them record from the CBP with travel record from 2011-2021 (that was what FOIA/CBP sent me) Yesterday I received a call from them again that the assistant consul still need more documents but they did not say which documents. My question is, is this normal? My daughter already have a U.S emergency passport issued by the U.S consulate in Merida Mexico and valid for 1year, can the officer at the U.S embassy in Mexico city denied my daughter's CRBA application even though she already have a U.S passport? I got my citizenship last year and I travel on business trips from time to time but maintain physical presence in the U.S.",

This is in Monterrey, MX.\n\nBut, we’ve heard that there may be delays in getting the CRBA appointment scheduled. For example, when the baby is born and we go to schedule the appointment, the next available appointment may not be for another 3 months.\n\nWhile we wait for our appointment date, are we able to travel (by car) back into the US and wait there? This CBP article says we only need the birth certificate to enter the US by land:\n\nhttps://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-3618?language=en_US\n\nHas anyone done this? As far as I’m aware we should be able to do this with no issues, but I want to hear from people that have either actually done it or know someone that has. Unfortunately with work I don’t think I’d be able to say in Mexico for an extended period of time (like 3 months).\n\nAlso, if anyone has recently had a birth in Mexico, and submitted the CRBA for the US, how long did it take you to get the appointment and go through the whole process?",

He, however, has lived in Mexico with relatives for most of his life after his parents divorced. We had a baby a few months ago and are looking to register him at the US Embassy in order to obtain his CRBA and then his US passport. We have 99% of the documentation they ask, except for what I think is most important: proof of my husband's physical presence in the US.\n\nHe did go back to the US when he was older and worked there for some years. Sadly, all of his paperwork (tax returns, W2s etc) was lost when his father passed away. \n\nIs there any way we could obtain copies of such documents? Could we maybe get a Social Security Statement? What do you suggest we do in this case, in your experience? Preferably whatever is easier and quicker, since we already took a long time to register baby in Mexico because of the apostille needed on husband's birth certificate.\n\nI hope I have explained the situation clearly; if you need further info just hit me up here.\n\nThanks!",
