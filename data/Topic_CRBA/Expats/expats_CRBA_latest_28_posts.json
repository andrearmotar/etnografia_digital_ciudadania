        "selftext": "Hey everyone! The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Mexico website provides the following as one of the requirements for requesting a CRBA, in both English in Spanish:\n\n>**Mexican Secretary of Health Birth Certificate:** Copy of the certificate given to the mother in the hospital after the child’s birth. If you submitted this document to the Civil Registry and do not have a copy, request a true copy from the Civil Registry. This document is also called a hospital birth certificate, certificado de alumbramiento, or nacido vivo.  \n\\[...\\]  \n**Certificado de Nacimiento expedido por la Secretaría de Salud:** Copia del certificado otorgado a la madre en el hospital después de nacimiento del menor. Si entregó este documento en el Registro Civil y no tiene una copia, puede solicitar una copia fiel al Registro Civil. Este documento también es conocido como certificado de nacimiento del hospital, certificado de alumbramiento, o nacido vivo.\n\nBy the time I had read the above, I had already handed over the hospital birth certificate (*certificado de nacimiento*) to the Mexico City Civil Registry to prepare my son's birth certificate (*acta de nacimiento*). However, I did make a black and white photocopy of the hospital birth certificate on both sides just before I handed it over.\n\nWill my photocopy count as a true copy, or do I need special certifications from the Civil Registry that received the original?",

        "selftext": "Hi there! I will probably be asking several questions about this process over the coming days.\n\nFor background, I am an American living in Mexico with my Mexican wife and our two-month-old baby son. Even though I've been in Mexico since I graduated from the university 11 years ago, I do meet the criteria to pass my citizenship on to him.\n\nSpecifically, since I am a US citizen who was married to a non-citizen during the birth of my son, I need to prove five years' presence in the US before his birth, at least two of which were after I was 14.\n\nTo do this, I have ordered my high school and college transcripts. The former covers the period from September 2002 to June 2006, and the latter from September 2006 to June 2011.\n\nNow, as far as I can tell, even the strictest reading of these transcripts alone should put me within the five years I need. However, I am curious, will they accept these transcripts as covering 3 years and 9 months for high school and 4 years and 9 months for college, or will they hair-splittingly attempt to deduct winter and summer breaks that those records technically don't account for? Or will they be as generous as to accept them as covering a full 8 years and 9 months?\n\nI should note that I lived in the US for the first 24 years of my life, so I definitely meet the requirement. I just want to know how many records I need to purchase and how much I need to bother my dad and brother back home before they visit me, my wife, and their new grandson/nephew for Christmas.\n\nAny insight is appreciated. Thanks a lot!",

Of course, if by “English translation” they mean “certified English translation,” we can work on that… we’ve just had so-so experiences with translators in the past. \nAnyone tried this route?",

        "selftext": "Hi. We had a baby a few months ago and are trying to register the birth at the US Embassy, but finding it SO crazy hard! Among the requirements, they want:\n\n* Medical Records\n* Marriage Contract\n* National Level Birth Certificate\n* US Notarization of Every Single Passport Page\n* Letters between spouses\n* Plane tickets together\n* Rental contract\n* IRS Income Taxes\n* Emails between spouses\n* US School Records\n* US Medical Records\n* Proof of relationship between spouses\n* Proof of US Residency-Not Passport (If your passport shows you left the US 1 month ago, how is that not proof you have been to the US?)\n* Photo Identification of Infant\n* Family Photos from the Moment of Birth, with both parents, and pictures at regular intervals up until the date of your appointment. Photos MUST show \"togetherness\" of both parents. (What does that even mean?)\n* Evidence of parents' US Citizenship\n* Military Statement of Service\n* DD-214\n* Medical Records of Pregnancy\n* DNA Test\n* Evidence of Physical Presence at Same Location on the Day of Conception (Do they want a sex tape?)\n* Evidence of the couple's relationship prior to conception (15 years of marriage and 4 kids is not enough to prove our relationship?)\n\nSo, the LAW simply states:\n\n**\"Child born to two U.S. citizen parents who are married at the time of birth: A child born outside of the United States or its outlying possessions to two U.S. citizen parents is entitled to citizenship, provided that one of the parents, prior to the birth of the child, had been resident in the United States (the law does not specify a specific length of residence time.)\"**\n\nSo I don't get all the requirements by the US Embassy? Why does the law sound so simple, but the requirements so hard? Like e-mail. I have never emailed my wife. Ever. She does not even have an email address! I have to go and make her an email address, send her some emails, \"Hi, hon. Sending you an email for the US Embassy. How about that conception day?\", print them, and submit them. WHY???\n\nOK, I am venting. But I want to share this with others. And I also want to find out in anyone knows what the purpose of all this is?  Thanks for reading!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: Thank for all your replies, guys! One thing! You know, another user pointed out possibly not needing a CRBA.**\n\n**According to the passport application, you don't! You can get a US Passport with a foreign birth certificate.**\n\n**So why do people file for the CRBA if it is such a pain in the ass!?**",
