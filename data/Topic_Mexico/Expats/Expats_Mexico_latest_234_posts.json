        "selftext": "Living and working in Mexico and trying to decide whether to give birth here and register a birth abroad, or plan to go back to the US to give birth. \n\nCurrently I meet eligibility to pass citizenship to my daughter through birth but I’m worried with the political climate whether that could change or she could later have fewer rights in the US if she were born in Mexico/has Mexican dual citizenship. \n\nOn the other hand, if she were born in the US it might be hard to get her a Mexican visa quick enough for me to return to work with her here? If anyone has experience with Mexican visa issues for dependents. I’m on a permanent residency for work purposes. \n\nAll insights welcome thank you!",
