        "selftext": "I was brought to the U.S. as a child and have been a lawful permanent resident since 1993. My father became a U.S. citizen before I turned 18, and I was living with him at the time. Based on what I‚Äôve read about **derivative citizenship under INA ¬ß320**, I should already be a U.S. citizen.\n\nI went to the post office recently to apply for a U.S. passport, but they told me I needed a **Certificate of Citizenship (N-600)** or naturalization certificate to prove my citizenship. I explained that I derived citizenship through my dad when I was a minor, but they said they couldn't process my application without official proof from USCIS. She looked at me and was like you were supposed to do this back then. Not now. I figured the post office would not be helpful in this matter. I then called the passport agency but they are telling me I need to provide an itinerary that I am going somewhere internationally before I get an appointment and also made mention of me needing my parents wedding certificate which I cant get. They were married in Mexico back in 83. \n\nI have the following 1. Dads naturalization certificate 2. 4 notarized affidavits that I was living with him one being from him. 3. my expired resident alien card at that time 4. my birth certificate 5. current state ID 6. The passport application itself. \n\n\n\n* Should I just go ahead and file Form **N-600** with USCIS?\n* Has anyone else successfully gotten a passport approved **without** the N-600 (maybe through affidavits or with the right documents)?\n* Is it worth hiring a lawyer for this, or can I handle it myself if I have the documents?\n\nAny insight or shared experiences would be really appreciated. I just want to get this resolved the right way.\n\nThanks in advance üôèüèº",

        "selftext": "Hello, everyone, I have debated posting about my situation on Reddit. Still, this will be the right place to get some advice as well as some encouragement. Here is a little background about myself: I was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2002 and then brought to the US three times. All three entries have been legal through business/tourist visas & dependent visas (the first entry being in 2006 - 4 years old, the second entry in 2007 - 5 years old, and the final entry in 2013 - 11 years old.) Due to my parents' uncertainty about where to settle, we have been coming out of the country until 2013, which is my latest entry, and we have been in the US since then. I have been struggling to live a \"normal\" life due to my inability to fix my status. I graduated high school in my hometown, where I lived most of my life.\n\nI will be graduating soon with a BBA in finance and applied economics. I also managed to land an internship for a reputable firm in commercial real estate with no pay. I now have a job offer upon graduation. I have also had my ITIN since 2021 and have money invested into the US stock market under a Roth IRA. I have talked with two attorneys on my own. My family has, too, making it a total of 4-5 attorneys we have contacted. We received the same information from the attorneys. There is no current law I can apply to fix my status since the timeline does not apply for DACA due to not being continuously living in the US. The other options are through marriage or a work visa. However, I am unaware of which one to pursue. I have been putting marriage off since I want to marry for love and genuine connection rather than a number. I do not know if the work pathway is a viable approach either, taking current policy changes and increasing business expenses. I currently have a girlfriend who is a US citizen that I have been dating for one year and six months but have known for two years and one month. I firmly believe she is the one as she supports me and understands me without judgment, and our connectivity is great. I am thinking of pulling the trigger on one of these options as I approach graduation in May as I need to grow my career for my future and that of my future family and really start my life and can't really keep waiting for a \"policy miracle\" I also do not have the financial support to continue education to stretch the timeline past this administration in hope for a better chance. Any advice and perspectives from what you would do in my shoes will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

One of the pieces of evidence I have heard would help is if my wife and I open a joint bank account together. \n\nI am a US citizen, she is a Mexican citizen, we have already submitted our case for a marriage based green card. I know that in the likely case that we are called in for an interview, we will be expected to have evidence additional to what we have already submitted. \n\nI have heard it is possible for a non-resident of the US to open a bank account, and in order to do this, proof of US address must be provided in the form of a document that shows both her name and the address to ensure she is associated with the property. That could include a letter with the name and address. \n\nWe are going to be living with my parents when she gets her green card, so I‚Äôm thinking we could use their address for the joint bank account, and have some sort of letter sent to my parent‚Äôs house addressed to my wife. \n\nI don‚Äôt know if this would work, but what is more important than if it would work, is if it would even help. Given that she has never even been to the US, never visited my parents home, I‚Äôm concerned that USCIS might see this and think we are being deceitful in opening a bank account together based in the US. \n\nBut I also want to get every scrap of evidence possible, which is why I am considering this one so much.

She currently lives in Mexico and I live in the U.S. She has a valid B-2 tourist visa is planning to move in with me in the U.S. in about a year. We are planning to marry and I am looking for the best way for us to get her a green card and work permission here in the U.S. We are a flexible on where and when we get married, we are just looking for the fastest/most efficient way to get her a green card and work permission considering our specific circumstances. The most important thing for her is that if she comes to the U.S. and begins the process, she has the option to go back to Mexico (for a short period in case of a family emergency, etc.) while the USCIS is processing her papers. The one snag I have as as the petitioner is that I have not filed taxes for the past 2-3 years. As far as the government is concerned, I have not made any income for the past 2-3 years. I was told that a family member of mine that makes a sufficient salary can fulfill this requirement with additional paperwork.\n\n¬†\n\nWhat do you think is the best option for us? Getting married in Mexico and filing for Consular Processing seems like an attractive option because she would be a legal permanent resident and have work permission when she enters the U.S. However, I don‚Äôt know how long it would take and if it takes a lot more than a year it would put additional stress on our long-distance relationship. It is possible I am misunderstanding how Consular Processing works. One lawyer told me the way he does most cases is to have the person enter using their tourist visa, wait the 90 days, get married, then file for adjustment of status. Is this a violation of her tourist visa? I am assuming this process the lawyer is using I-130?, I-485?, I-131?, and/or I-765?. Is this our best option? He said it is not recommended to leave the country while they are processing but that it could be done.\n\n¬†\n\nI think my question is relatively simple but after a few hours of reading through the requirements/limitations of each possible route, I still don‚Äôt have much clarity on which suits us best for our circumstances. Any insight is greatly appreciated. We may consult further with a lawyer for \\~$300 but we would prefer to save the $3500 lawyer fees of filing and file the papers ourselves unless it is not recommended.",

I know next to nothing about the processes but what are some options she has to stay here legally? We are in a very conservative part of Texas idk if that matters. If she has to apply from Mexico, will she be able to get back in? I read in an article that for certain visas you have to apply from your home country.\n\nThank you in advance!!\n\nETA: I am obviously not going to rely solely on internet strangers, but it's been very overwhelming to find a starting point on our own.

Thank you!\n\n  \nEdit 2: With the help of some comments and research from there, the best option is an i601A and going from there. It's a long road ahead for anyone wondering the same thing we were and basically if you don't marry a citizen, it will be decades or longer :( Her father is a citizen (not natural born) so we're hoping that helps. Wish us luck! ",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend of over 2 years is worried that once we marry she will not be able to come to America. We‚Äôre planning out our wedding right now, but with families in different countries it‚Äôs not the easiest. So we‚Äôre figuring out logistics in that sense. At the end of it all I know our wedding will be held in Mexico. She is greatly worried about Donald trump making it more difficult for her. I am trying to ease her worry that this is not the case. Yes, I know there are many people that are vulnerable, but I do not believe our situation is within this concern. She has never been to the United States (therefor never abused/ violated immigration laws). I‚Äôve spoken to an immigration lawyer and she says my gf will conduct her process in Mexico at a U.S. embassy. Which is fine since she lives basically in Mexico City (Ecatepec). We have been dating over 2 years, have receipts of me traveling to Mexico every month for one week. Pictures, the lot. So the proof of our relationship is there. I think once we get close to having wedding plans set then we should get a joint bank account to the very least. (Which I‚Äôm not sure if it would be possible for her and me in the US or her and me in Mexico for best results). She currently works for the Mexican government and is in charge of billings of all federal buildings for the entirety of Mexico. She has no criminal record, no tattoos, nothing that would insinuate ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù.  She does have some family that was involved with a cartel, but the uncle was murdered when she was young, and the son of the uncle is basically rejected from her immediate family. And the cousin is already barred from entering America. So her immediate family has no ties or relation to any crime syndicates. Her bank account isn‚Äôt necessarily large due to the fact that the Mexican government pays her around 600$ per month. (I‚Äôm not sure if her finance is considered). But she has no bills since she lives with her family. Once we marry I will submit the marriage certificate in the US as well as Mexico. All the usual denials with spousal GC don‚Äôt seem to apply to her at all. I understand people are worried now and exclaim their deportation worries, but it seems lots of people leave out crucial information to create more worry to others, and or they exclaim very legal reasons as to why they would either deal with deportation or denial.\n\nIf there is any other information that may be pertinent I can provide it. But from the brief conversation with the immigration lawyer and information on government websites it doesn‚Äôt seem as if she should have a genuine worry. She‚Äôs never done anything to put herself in the basket of people that should worry. If I am wrong then tell me. I don‚Äôt seek political bias info and I don‚Äôt care what your political affiliation is. I just simply want to know based on this situation if she has a genuine worry. I‚Äôm seeking to calm her down, not speak to her about politics that don‚Äôt involve our own situation. \n\nThanks.  \n\nEdit: regarding schooling she has a bachelors from an accredited university in Mexico City. It slightly confuses me due to the difference of college in the US and Mexico. She graduated and walked, but she says she must complete her thesis to gain her ‚Äútitle‚Äù. So she is finished with classes, walked on stage, but needs to complete her thesis. I am not positive if this means that she has an American equivalent of a bachelors already, or if this comes after her thesis is submitted. I myself am currently still in college (4 classes left before I graduate). \n\nAs well, I currently work part time so the sponsorship is quite vague at the moment. My previous job the income amount greatly exceeded the requirement, but I changed jobs. So depending on the timeline I‚Äôm not positive if my dad would be considered the sponsor (150,000+ per year) or if I should take a break from school and increase my hours for one year to meet the requirements for sponsorship. I do make majority of my money trading within the stock market which allows me to work part time and travel to Mexico every month for a week each month. I‚Äôm not positive as to whether financial investments are included in the sponsorship requirement due the to fact that it‚Äôs not a consistent number, unlike a w-2. ",
