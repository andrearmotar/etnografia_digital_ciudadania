        "selftext": "I just want to openly debate and offer my perspective as lived experience, immigrant myself coming into this country in 2012 legally. I dont get why a lot of people support illegal immigration policies and open borders. \n\nThis is not a troll or anything, I want to understand and have genuine discourse which I think we lack lately as people are quick to jump conclusions and paint others with right/left/center/racist/facist or whater you want. \n\nLet me give you a few details of how legal immigration works(from my experience) and then I would write an arguments why it needs to be overhauled, but not with opening borders as its bad for the country and bad for people coming over here illegally. \n\nI came to the US in 2012. I had to submit any imaginable paperwork living person can conjure, birth certificate, passport, background checks, my education, high school diploma, collage, my work experience, references, etc. \n\nFirst interview was in my country in the US embassy, questions about my past and current allegiance, why I was going, and even stupid ones which I thought was silly - are you going to try destabilize the USA government? Are you part of terrorist organization? (I was like even if someone was trying who would say yes lol). Anyway, many forms followed, my biometric pictures, finger prints(I guess for extra background check), sponsors here, their recommendations, etc. Very long process. Finally, the last part after I was approved to come over was my vaccination documents from childhood, I had to submit them and any vaccines my country might not required or by USA standards needed boosting I had to get in the US embassy approved clinic before leaving. \n\nComing into JFK was another stop for my photo, fingerprints. When in the USA, I was called into immigration center for another interview, few weeks or month or so later I got my ssn card and green card, which gave me permission to work. I started applying to jobs and from here normal story you have heard probably millions times. I dont want to retell all my struggles or diminish any others but it is a story you probably familiar  with, very real by the way. Anyway that is not the point of my post. All immigrants go through this one way or another, how hard it is to leave family, friends, integrate into different country, language issues/accent, etc etc.\n\nI had one more interview about one year been here, more like touch point what I was doing etc.  Two years later I had to resubmit some of what I have been doing in the country, one more interview with background check from my local sheriff's office (I am sure they did more background checks themselves to make sure I was not involved in any criminal activity) thats when I was granted permanent green card. After holding permanent green card for over 5 years, I went and passed exam for citizenship and got naturalized. \n\nNow my perspective on the process pros: \n1) You are screen so deliberately and carefully that it is almost impossible to come over in the USA for any ill intent. Criminal record pretty much gets you automatic denial(I had none, so not sure exactly but many forms ask the question and you have yo go through multiple background checks). \n\n2) Again, screening is so intense that you have yo provide your vaccination results from childhood to make sure no diseases are brought in the country. \n\n3) During the interviews and countless paperwork submissions, people are screened who would be functioning members of society, who can integrate well and bring good to the USA. (I never actually worked or known anyone close who works for immigration office, just this was my perspective as I was going through these myself).\n\n4) The whole process somewhat prepares you what to expect, you go through so much paperwork and interviews that you need to have basic knowledge of English. It is drilled into you that crime is bad(you cant come into the country with record). Moreover during the probationary period (temp green card you get before permanent) if you commit any crime you are going back to your country,  as you would lose your status.  \n\nCons: \nMy main problem with current process is how hard it is to go through it even if you are qualified or eligible. The paperwork, bureaucracy is insane. It is so tedious that many times I felt like giving up. You might have noticed how many times I had to submit paperwork, its not that mistyped and wrote it few times,  no if anything I missed more times I had to submit papers before interviews or afterwards, it is constant. \n\nInterviews are brutal, sometimes it feels like you are interrogated as if you are already guilty of something and you have to prove your innocence. Many immigration officers, workers are rude and sometimes assholes, not sure deliberately or not. I encountered dozens of workers for years and can only recall two people who I could say were nice. Again this is my perspective, can be a requirement for a job to screen criminals? To me many of them could have been nicer. \n\nCurrent limit on legal immigration is set to 650,000 a year I believe. If we needs more immigrants, then we need to losen requirements and make process easier. Make this number 1,000,000 and simplify the process and actually set people up for success. \n\n‐-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove I outlined my story, my perspective on legal immigration, here I will focus on illegal immigration and whats my perspective on this. \n\nFirst why it is bad for the USA: \n\n\n- Criminals, terrorist, bad people! Allowing everyone to come here, you will also let bad people come through in much more higher numbers than before. As I described due process above, even that can be gamed and criminals can forge the papers, lie on interview and all that but I hope you understand amount of effort they need to put in that process than here.\nAlso, let me explain why America has for a lucrative aspect for just every day criminals too. If you are in any other country stealing you will get less money than stealing in the USA for the same stuff. And many times USA has much more lenient laws than country of origin. \n\n\n- Living standard disparity between US and other countries encourages some people to sit on gov aid and do nothing, because it is much much better than where they came from. You want this or not it is true, I know many who do this.(Many would paint me as traitor to my community as immigrant myself but fact is fact and I want to give you my honest thoughts on this issue). \n\n\n- Health care much higher standard than some other countries. It is true that for working Americans most will not qualify for medicaid and healthcare can be very expensive but lot of people who came over jumped on medicaid. (trigger warning, probably I will be called names again for this but I know people who do this and are currently on it). \n\n\n- Vaccination and potential for bringing some diseases into the country, read my point above. People crossing over dont go through same scrutiny. \n\n\n- Empathy to the point where our country can be ruined. The most people who have not been outside the US, dont understand that 80-90% of the worlds countries have worst economies than USA or face some type of discrimination based on their sex, beliefs, orientation, list goes on. If you open up borders and let everyone who has financial difficulties come in, the country would be overrun. This means there is billion people right now who would leave everything and move if they could. \n\n\n- Lowering wages for certain industries. Many illegals are hired for exploitation and are paid cents on the dollar to do the work. This lowers overall wages for legal workers too and incentivizes those industries to hire illegals. \n\n\n- Making cartels and criminals super rich for smuggling people to the border. Again, because I am immigrant I personally know sooo many people who paid tens of thousands of dollars per person to get in the country. Now multiply this by millions, you get the idea. They can invest this money to better smuggle drugs and fund their nefarious activities, just common sense. \nIf you think that you can come over the border by yourself, without paying smugglers, you are wrong, in real life 99.9% coming over border had to pay up. \n\n\n- Overall illegal immigration is a net draw on the country and open borders are not sustainable. We can be accommodating for some time until we have massive collapse and massive issues which can not be rectified or we can take approach to overhaul legal process if more immigrants are needed and work on that part. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nSecond, why this is bad for people coming illegally: \n\n- There is a myth out there that you only need to get into the USA and that is it, people who come here without due process are not prepared. They can not integrate into society, they dont know English, they are not ready because to them hardest part was just crossing the border which is not true. It is very hard to be in the country, with no family, friends, no language or culture knowledge and then face extra pressure having no papers to get legal work. Because of this they are limited what they can do and this pressures them to do something they would have not done in their countries, it is especially hard for males. Fact is that females can get work  easier than males, I cant tell you how many males I know from my country who came here bright eyed spend all their life savings and sank into drugs and we had to send them back in caskets. \n\n- Work exploitation, when you are illegally hired you have no rights. Who do you complain when you are paid cents on a dollar? When you work 12-16 hours a day and get no overtime? When boss abuses you? Nobody, because the moment you say something you are out of the door or are threatened you will be reported to authorities and to get anothet job can take months. This is the point I dont understand people supporting saying, oh who will go and farm for you? Who will build houses for you? Who will clean streets for you? Who will care cheap for your grandparents? you are okay having cheap exploited labor to have cheap food, houses, goods and claim moral high ground? \n\n- People who come over here illegally are subjected to such horrors that some are impossible to imagine. Days in boats crossing lakes and ocean with just bread and water, days of hicking into swamps, forests, smuggled into stinky vans. Fear of seeing armed people in the countries escorting you somewhere you hope is the border and not some hole to be killed. I mean you should know someone who went through bad smuggling over the border to understand how bad it is. Not everyone goes to extreme difficult crossing as I described, but its easy for people to comment on issues like that who work 41 hour a week and take mental recover day next week because they worked 1 extra hour prior. I will be honest here most of you dont understand what they go through. \n\n- When administration of one or another first world country opens borders for illegal immigration, word gets out. I visited my country or origin in 2022 and I was flabbergasted how many strangers who I got to talk to were telling me were coming over. And they all thought hardest part was just getting through the border. The prevalent myth as I described above is you only need to get through the border to be successful. Most who I talked to had no knowledge of English or knew not what would they do when in the USA, I tried to explain but you have seen American dream in movies, hard to get people to understand its not all roses and rainbows. The story was completely different when I was back to my country in 2016, no one was talking coming over via Mexico most questions I got was how to apply for green card and if I could help some of my acquaintances and friends with forms which I did. \n\n‐----------------------\n\nLet me adress something where people can write that I contradict myself and that both my statements cant be true. \n\nI stated that many people come over here to game the system and stay latched on government support forever but I also stated that people coming over are exploited for work how can both be true? Because there are people who come over for gaming the system but there are also good, hard working, ambitions people who come here to do more and want even better lives(which are majority by the way). Only sad part is that from the beginning they are set up for failure, most of them spent last penny paying smugglers to get here, know no language and face extra challenges of having no papers. They are overworked and underpaid, their dreams crumble facing reality of dead end no pay jobs doing construction, cleaning, hospitality, care giving, etc. Thus many fall to drugs and other things they would have never done in their country of origin,  read my point again sending caskets back. \n\n-------------------------\n\nI whole heartedly support deporting:\n\n- Criminals of any type, I dont care if you stole a pair of socks in your country of origin (if you are found out to have a record back home) or here, you get deported period. \n\n- People who had social security numbers and work authorization given but have done nothing for years, are still sitting on government help programs pretending they are seeking the job. \n\n- People left after we got rid of the above groups are individuals who came here because of former administration's crime. Word got out borders were open and you could get in the US, as I described in my previous posts how many had to sell everything, pay last penny go through so many difficulties to cross over. While as adults they took responsibility and still knew they were coming illegally, administration encouraged it which is a tragedy. I personally know very good hard working people and this is why I am torn. One point they are illegally here but same time idiots from previous admin pushed message it was okay. I feel like I go in circles and circles on this point because I am truly torn. I dont know if some kind of help can be given to them but in the end they are here illegally and need to go back. I just wish whoever was responsible tricking them to come here would face justice causing so much pain and suffering, but I know it will never happen. I hope we just learn the lesson and never repeat this again, because as I described in general its not good for the country and for people coming here (There are very few exceptions but in general its negative all around). \n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis is my lived experience and my honest opinion why illegal emigration is overall bad for the country and also bad for most people who are coming over naively that everything is going to be great. \n\nI know I will get a lot of grief, but I dont care. Only one thing I ask, stay respectful to each other and lets have a dialog maybe we can change each others minds? Dont jump to conclusions. \n\nIf you made it all the way here I want to thank you, my English is not perfect nor did I proof read this or had AI correct it for me, I  just poured out my heart on the issue I am passionate about and want to know your honest opinion why would you support illegal immigration? How is this good for the country or people coming over? \n------------------------ ",

I just had a consultation with a lawyer to see what my options are for citizenship/green card, etc. \nA little about me:\nMy mother brought me here when I was 3 illegally from Mexico . I have 6 other brothers and sisters who are all American citizens. My mother lost custody of us due to neglect and abuse and we were placed in foster care where I was adopted in 2001 at the age of 12 by an American woman. I have a foreign birth certificate and a social. Fast forward to now. I’ve been married for 9months to an American citizen but have been with my husband for 10 years. We have 3 kids together.  I spoke with the lawyer full heartedly believing the lawyer would suggest my husband sponsor me but was very surprised to hear him say he’d like to try derivative citizenship. Would that actually apply to me? He also mentioned something about The Hague convention aide. If I’m spelling that correctly, idk it was a lot of information thrown at me pretty fast. I have another consultation in a couple weeks to be able to compare the paths suggested. Thank you in advance for reading and any potential help. God bless! \n \n",

        "selftext": "Hi! My family and I are planning to move to Mexico in a few months to (hopefully) avoid a deportation. We are trying to take care of as much paperwork while still in the US as we can, but I am running into a few issues while trying to find info about the family unity program and haven't been able to get answers from our consulate. To help explain, here is the make-up of our family \n\nHusband- Mexican National\nMe- US citizen\nChild 1- US born to me and another US citizen (stepchild of husband)\nChild 2- US born to me and husband\nChild 3- US born to me and husband\n\nSo far I *think* the best option is to apply for Child 2 & 3 to gain dual citizenship and then apply for my own permanent residency as the parent of mexican nationals, but unsure if this can all be done during one visit or if will need to wait between applying for them and then myself. Any clarification on that would be helpful! \n\nHere are my main questions and I'd appreciate any insight you have:\n1. For Child #1 is it better to file for family unity using his stepfather citizenship or his siblings, I believe both are options but am unsure if there's a benefit to one over the other\n2. For most of this paperwork I keep seeing that mothers name (me) needs to be the same on all identification as it is on the child's birth certificates. This is not the case as my name has since changed. I called my local records office to see if changing it on the birth certificates is an option and was told that it isn't because the birth certificate states \"mothers maiden name\". The name on my passport and ID are both my married name which didn't occur until after all three kids were born. Will this cause a problem?\n3. We live several hours from the closest embassy and hope for cost reasons to only have to make one trip. Can all of this be done during the same trip or does there need to be a waiting period between any of them?\n4. The documents listed on the website seem straight forward (birth certificates and IDs mostly) and don't mention needing to be translated or apostilled, but I've seen in other places that they DO need to be. I can't get clarification of this and don't want to do so unless necessary as it will be pretty expensive.\n\nOur plan is to leave in the next 4 months, so we are on a bit of a time crunch and I'm hoping this is all possible within that time frame! We can't wait longer because there are currently raids happening in our area and my husband is more at risk of being deported the longer we stay, which will make things infinity more complicated! \n\nThanks in advance for any information!",

She was carrying disposable trays and supplies to make sushi which she was planning to help my other aunt to help make for a party at her house. Aunt 2 is a U.S resident. The trays contained for sale stickers. \n\nMy Aunt was detained and kept by the officers in the border crossing office for around 10 hours. Where she claims she was verbally abused, treated like a criminal, and accused of attempting to stay in the U.S illegally. She has her whole life in Mexico and has no plans of moving legally or illegally to the U.S, but she does travel here frequently to visit. She explained all this to the officers, who ignored her and continued to accuse her and abuse her verbally, even threatening her with jail or extended detainment if she did not sign some documents. Which were all in English, she does not speak or read English.\n\nEventually, after many hours of this, she signed the paperwork, they took her Visa, and she was allowed to go home.\n\nThis is not the first time they do this. An uncle of mine, who is a nurse in Mexico, was also treated similarly. In his case he had left his car In the U.S and used a different car to cross the border. They accused him of staying illegally, treated him similarly, and forced him to sign some documents which stated he was an illegal immigrant living in the U.S. He could neither read or understand the document as it was  written in English and they had taken his glasses, which he needed to read. \n\nMy questions are:\n\nIs this legal? They had very little evidence to back their wild accusations and used threats and verbal abuse to accomplish this.\n\nCan the documents be nullified as they were signed under duress? As previously mentioned the were mistreated and threatened.\n\nCan we even fight it? My relatives were not read their rights or given any courtesy, and they were threatened with jailtime and refused any calls.\n\nI know very little about law, and would appreciate some advice. My relatives are not heartbroken, sure they are sad and disheartened but happy to be back home with their families. But as a U.S citizen I am angered by the way they were treated. And would like to see some justice.  \n\n",

I had been a DACA recipient since April 2013, and I just arrived back home last night from my consular appointment in Juárez. Here’s how my process went from start to finish:\n\nFirst DACA Approval: 4/15/2013 \n\nMarried to USC: 12/18/2021 \n\nFiled I-130: 7/18/2022 \n\nReceived RFE and Submitted: 7/27/2022 \n\nI-130 Approved: 10/17/2023 \n\nReceived NVC Notice to Submit Paperwork/DS-260: 11/29/2023 \n\nReceived Consular Appointment: 11/25/2024\n\n**Consular Process:**\n\nDoctor & Biometrics Appointment: 1/24/2025 \n\n1st Consular Appointment (Paperwork Check): 1/29/2025 \n\n2nd Consular Appointment (Official Interview): 1/30/2025 \n\nReceived Email to Pick Up Passport at Embassy: 2/1/2025\n\n**Things to Note:** \n\nA lawyer guided me through the beginning of the process and helped me submit my I-130, which I mailed physically. After that, I used AI to assist with everything else.\n\nI did not apply for Advance Parole because I felt my process was already well underway and didn’t see the need to hire a lawyer for it. I also had no reason to believe USCIS would deny my case.\n\nI did not apply for a waiver because I only accumulated 88 days of unlawful presence in the U.S. I had 59 days from my 18th birthday to my first DACA approval. I also had a 29-day gap between my second and third DACA approvals, which was due to USCIS delays at the time.\n\nI was told by many that I did not need a police certificate since I was a child when I migrated from Mexico and had never returned. However, for peace of mind, I decided to get one while in Mexico. I requested it online and received a PDF via email within a few hours. The consulate returned the document to me and confirmed that I did not need it.\n\nAside from the required paperwork, I also took my work permits and DACA approval letters. I had misplaced two work permit cards but brought the approval letters, which were sufficient for my interview.\n\n**Day-by-Day Experience in Juárez:** \n\nThursday, 1/23 (Day 1): Drove from Arizona to Juárez and arrived at night. We stayed at City Express on Boulevard Tomás Fernández since it was cheaper and we had a car (only a 10-minute drive to the consulate). The area felt safe, and we tried many restaurants where everyone was extremely kind.\n\nFriday, 1/24 (Day 2): Doctor’s Appointment: 7 AM – Took 1 hour and 30 minutes. Everything was well-organized and quick. I did not need any vaccines since I got them all in the U.S. in advance (insurance covered them).\n\nBiometrics Appointment: 3 PM – Took about an hour. They only asked for my passport and DS-260 confirmation page. I forgot my DS-260 confirmation page, but I quickly printed it next door in under five minutes. I had to get back in line, but it was no hassle.\n\nSaturday & Sunday, 1/25-1/26 (Days 3 & 4): We explored the city, which was beautiful. We felt safe, and having a car was a huge plus.\n\nMonday & Tuesday, 1/27-1/28 (Days 5 & 6): Worked remotely from the hotel. Nothing fancy, but we went out to eat at nearby places and had a great time trying delicious foods.\n\nWednesday, 1/29 (Day 7)- 1st Consular Appointment (Paperwork Check): Appointment was at 7 AM (arrived at 6:15 AM). I waited about 20 minutes before going in. The process was smooth and took about 2 hours. It felt like a DMV visit, but instead of getting called by numbers, you move through a series of lines. They asked for my DS-260 confirmation page and the doctor’s appointment confirmation page. After that, they move you to a different section where they collected my DS-260 form, passport, and doctor’s confirmation page. They also requested: my husband’s and my birth certificates, marriage license, my passport, and my police certificate (which they confirmed I didn’t need). They clipped everything together along with a blue paper that had my appointment for the next day.\n\nThursday, 1/30 (Day 8) – 2nd Consular Appointment (Official Interview): Appointment was set for 7:30 AM – I arrived at the same time as the previous day. I waited longer in line, but once inside, everything went quickly. The interview sections are open, so you can hear others getting approved or denied—this made the atmosphere very nerve-wracking! My interview lasted under 5 minutes. I was asked: where I live, when did I crossed to the U.S., if it was my only time crossing, the meaning of my tattoos, and once she saw in the computer that I have DACA, she asked for all my DACA approvals. The officer approved my case and gave me a green paper, instructing me to wait for an email notification to pick up my passport.\n\nFriday, 1/31 (Day 9): Worked remotely from the hotel and paid for my green card. The green paper that had my approval had instructions to order my green card online, which cost $245 + taxes.\n\nSaturday, 2/1 (Day 10) – Passport Pickup: Received the email notification at 8am to pick up my passport. Went to the embassy (same place as biometrics), waited in line, and presented: Email confirmation number A form of ID They returned my passport with my temporary visa (valid for one year until I receive my green card).\n\nSunday, 2/2 (Day 11) – Returning to the U.S.: Paid $2.20 to cross back into the U.S. At the checkpoint, an officer took me into a room where people crossing on foot were processed. It had a lot of chairs, but since it was early, it was empty. I handed my passport to the officer at the window, who scanned it, stamped it, and sent me on my way—no questions asked.\n\n**Total spent for my process doing it myself: $1,575**\n\nI-130 Application Fee: $535 \n\nImmigrant Visa Fee: $325\n\nAffidavit of Support Fee: $120\n\nGreen Card fee: $245\n\nLawyer Fee: $350 (**ONLY** to submit I-130 application)\n\n\nThis was the most life-changing yet nerve-wracking experience of my life. I waited for this moment for almost my entire life, and the fear of being denied was overwhelming.\n\nBeing in Juárez, surrounded by thousands of people in the same situation, is an indescribable feeling. I hope this run-through gives you a glimpse of what the process is like out there.\n\nHappy to answer any questions!",

        "selftext": "Is there anyone here that’s decided to self deport? \n\nI’m getting scared and nervous about the political situation here and my husband and I are both on the same page that maybe it’s not worthwhile applying and waiting for a 601a. We barely just got the I-130 approved I don’t want to be here stressed and worried any longer. \n\nThe only thing that’s kept us here is I can’t take my older kids and I’m feeling guilt and unsure how to move forward to without taking them. Their dad won’t allow me to take them.  We went to court for it before in 2021 because he claimed I would abduct them to Mexico. That was after he previously gave me permission to leave with them in 2018, however I didn’t end up leaving at that time. Now he’s going to hold our kids hostage here and not let them leave to a safer place with me. He is pro this administration and I’m obviously the opposite. I feel guilt and shame at the idea of abandoning my two oldest children but at what point will it be too unsafe for my husband and our younger children, who by the way are definitely not even the slightest bit white passing. I’m also Hispanic but white passing. We live in a red state and I don’t feel safe here. I believe we will become targets in our community because there’s only 3% Latino/Hispanic population here. \n\nI ordered birth certificates for mine and my husbands baby to get a passport but I feel like it’s going to take too long to get a passport back for her. Our other child also already has a passport to travel. \n\nIf my husband went to the border and just wanted got go across with our two kids would he be allowed if he showed them our babies birth certificate only? Would they let her in too or no? \n\nI’m considering just sending him and our 5 year old and 9 month old to Mexico without me. That seems horrible but I’m not sure what else to do. \n\nI’ve present the facts over and over that our life will be different but I believe we would have a higher quality of life in Mexico and my ex husband does not budge at all. Our kids are 14 and almost 11. \n\nAny advice? ",

        "selftext": "This is a hypothetical situation. Or maybe its for a friend. Or maybe its for some other stranger on the internet. Or maybe I just like testing the sub's knowledge. I don't know shit about fuck. I prefer ice that melts.\n\nForgive the long post, but here we go:\n\nThe situation involves an elderly person well over 70 yrs old. This person has been in the United States since the 1950's. This person worked and paid taxes their whole lives. When this person applied for Social Security benefits some time ago, it was denied because of immigration status. The person's family was baffled. So the research and investigations began. Consider the following items about the person:\n\n\\- born in Mexico, has a Mexican birth certificate\n\n\\- born to an American citizen mother and Mexican father (no, this is not automatic, the law at the time required proof that the mom lived in the US for a certain amount of time, which she did)\n\n\\- came to the US as a young child\n\n\\- at some point in early adulthood, person filed for naturalization based on his mother's citizenship and US residence \n\n\\- person is now of older age and doesn't remember much from that time\n\n\\- person has a Social Security number issued from Texas in the 1950's\n\n\\- person has been married to an American citizen since the early 1980's\n\n\\- person worked legally (everyone assumes) for decades; even after eVerify became a thing, the person always qualified and was cleared as eligible for work until as recently as 2019\n\n\\- family tried to get info from USCIS, but none of the correspondence actually verifies his status, and they were only told that the prior Naturalization Application form was filled out incorrectly (no mention of eventual denial, acceptance, etc..)\n\n\\- family FOIA-ed a copy of the Naturalization Application, there are some administrative markings on it but nothing that says it was approved or denied\n\n\\- at the time of that application, the person did have an A- number. the person nor the family do not remember the person ever having a green card in recent years and always assumed they were a citizen\n\n\\- family tried to re-file Naturalization Application but it was not accepted (not denied, but kicked back) because the previous one was not filed out correctly\n\n\\- person has multiple other siblings that were in the same situation, some older and some younger, all born to same American mom and Mexican dad, and all of those siblings were naturalized long ago and are citizens\n\n\\- several lawyers have looked into this, and none have ultimately taken the case because of the complexity\n\nHERE'S THE KICKER: not too long ago, the person refiled for Social Security benefits, and was approved! They are getting their monthly check and are enrolled in Medicare. BUT, they can't cash the checks because they don't have a bank account in their name. The person only has an expired state driver's license, which expired around the same time as the discovery of this issue, so they have not been able to get a new ID with the new Real ID requirements.\n\nSo that's a partially happy ending with the SS benefits. But they need an ID and bank account, and the family is still not sure of the person's status. In order to get a Real ID, the DMV requires their Social Security benefits letter AND either their certificate of naturalization or other proof of citizenship.\n\nHERE'S THE ASK: How and where can the family safely verify status without raising any red flags? They are understandably nervous about the current climate, and they also don't want this to have been a mistake and have the benefits snatched back if they still can't prove eligibility.\n\nThe best case here is that the first time they filed, it was denied by mistake, and they have been a citizen all along. The fact that they have been working for forever, and that they always clear through eVerify, and that the SS benefits were eventually approved, probably means that AT LEAST they are a permanent resident (but again, no one remembers, has seen, or has ever had to use a green card for this person).\n\nAny ideas or resources you guys might have would be a world of help. Also referrals to a reputable lawyer that might be up for the challenge would also be amazing. Thanks in advance!\n\nTLDR: Older person doesn't know their status. It's a complex tale but all signs point to likely permanent residence or citizenship. Family needs help safely verifying without raising red flags.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account, for obvious reasons. \n\nI am a U.S. citizen, my husband is an immigrant. He is currently classified as an NRA. We were married in October, and have been together for over 6 years. Yes, he was hesitant to get all his sh*t together before we got together- he was not well educated on the matter and was not with partner(s) who cared to help him. He has lived in fear for so long. I hate this for my husband.\n\nWe are waiting on his FOIA (requested in September 2024) before filing form I-485 and the accompanying forms, including my petition as his spouse. He has been here since a child (I want to say 4 years old or so), and he entered lawfully. However, there was a deportation order given. His mother claims the agent opened the van during transport and told him, his family, and other (strangers) immigrants to \"go.\" And he has been here ever since. He didn't qualify for DACA, I believe because- yet again- his hesitance in filing anything, and the amount time having passed was also against him. \n\nCan anyone give me any reassurance or pure honesty, based on their experience with a similar matter? We have an immigration lawyer- she is who assisted us in getting his A-number, passport, birth certificate, and filing the FOIA request. He deals with her directly and I feel bad always hitting him with a new question (\"what about this, this, and this\"; or \"ask her if we can do this\"). I would like a constant flow of information, such as this forum, even if they are simply unqualified opinions.\n\nThank you all for reading. I pray for everyone at this moment.",

I speak basic Spanish, and my sister is somewhat fluent, is fluency a requirement for citizenship? I also have no current plans to move to Mexico and I don’t feel like paying taxes in both countries if that is something I’d need to do. Sidenote; my mom is deceased but we have copies of her birth/death certificate. Would her being deceased somehow disqualify us? Please let me know your thoughts and opinions!

        "selftext": "I was with an American girl for a good while in my life, we wanted to live together; however, we're from different countries and she has a kid so I ended up agreeing to be the one who moves for the other, as much as I would have preferred to carry on living in Europe; however, it was something I was willing to sacrifice for the woman I loved. During this time, I found myself having a headache trying to navigate confusing resources regarding how we should go about the process of closing the distance between each other. I am making this post to explain some things I've learned to somebody who may be in the same boat I was, a long time ago. We have broken up since and I'm much happier with her out of my life but I have learned valuable information and I wish that a pair of lovers out there can make better use of it than me and my ex were able to.      \n\nMy ex wanted us to get married when I was visiting her in the USA; however, I refused. (dodged a bullet of a lifetime)     \n\nI refused to marry who I thought to be the love of my life, because, as far as I was aware, marrying an American on American soil as an alien requires a K1 Visa; which at the time, we were not able to back financially due to her not meeting the income requirements of being a sponsor. I believed that if I were to visit her and marry her on her whim, I would be committing visa fraud, which carries a long prison penalty and can lead to permanent deportation from the USA. Needless to say, I was wrong.      \n\nI entered the USA on my ESTA, which actually allows you to marry in the United States; however, it is only permissible under the condition that you do not intend to remain in the USA afterwards and will leave within the time period the ESTA allows you to stay for. Later on, marrying in this way may allow your partner to file for you as an immigrant spouse, allowing you two to apply for a CR1 or IR1 green card, assuming your partner is able to sponsor you.     \n\nMy ex was a single mother and unemployed for a majority of the relationship. While it seems reasonable for a single person to be somewhat comfortably able to sponsor a spouse on an average income, the income requirements increase depending on how many dependents the sponsor has. My ex being a single mother made it quite difficult for her to reasonably reach this income level, especially when the job she eventually did find, she'd have to take days off quite often because she had difficulty with securing childcare and the father was absent and wasn't even on the birth certificate and there was no child support settlement so whatever scraps he'd occasionally throw her on cashapp when she came begging wouldn't really count towards her taxed income, making it a non-factor to USCIS.      \n\nWith this in mind, we had to look for a joint sponsor. A joint sponsor can be anybody who is willing to take on the burden of being a sponsor who has the means of sponsoring your spouse. Her mother made just enough to have been able to back the sponsorship; however, another option I had discovered was the ability to have two joint sponsors at once; however, struggled to find much more information on the intricacies of this option. Some resources said that if you are to be sponsored by two people, it must be a pair with joined income, such as a married couple; however, I am unsure to what extent this is true, as information on dual sponsors is difficult to come by online and the resources I did find weren't very specific on how it works. Sponsors may also be able to wager their property, if adequately high in value, to make up for any income requirement shortcomings.    \n\nAdditionally, I would like to go over the bona fide relationship proof process, as I rarely see it being spoken about at its true length. Me and my ex had a genuine relationship, I loved her, I loved her daughter to death, and I loved her family. Having trouble proving your that relationship is genuine will typically not come as much of a problem to real couples, assuming you remain conscious of the process and take the necessary steps together throughout your time together to make sure that nobody can poke holes in your relationship and doubt it. Remember to take many photos together, especially if you are in a long distance relationship like I was. Make sure to save everything that links the two of you together. Save gifts, save letters, save flight tickets, everything you can get your hands on that shows that you two share a past together. You really don't need to overkill it, just show that you two love each other and that this is something serious that has been going on for a fairly long period of time. Forget about hauling ass across the world for a girl you met on discord three days ago, is what I'm trying to get at here.     \n\nYou will need to prove your relationship is bona fide, when applying for a K1 visa, or a CR1/IR1 green card. You do not need to prove your relationship is bona fide, when you enter the USA to marry on an ESTA; however, as far as I am aware, if you disclose this while entering the USA at border control you will be subject to significantly more scrutiny and will likely be dragged to secondary inspection. When I would visit the USA I'd just disclose at the border that I am visiting my girlfriend for the week and despite showing the return flight and asserting I have a life back home I can't just abandon on a whim, without fail, the lovely border officers made sure my ex waits a couple more hours at the airport. I never had an issues at secondary control, though, I'd just show them everything, including our texts planning our week together, and I was let through without a hassle.     \n\nI'd imagine that if you can reasonably prove you are going to return home after marrying on an ESTA you should be fine as well; however, if you've already flown there and spend hundreds if not thousands for the flight, just be low-key and tell them you're visiting your partner. You can just haul ass back home afterwards with a ring on your finger. You can also claim you were proposed to while there and married with no prior intentions in the heat of the moment. Marrying in the USA is pretty easy you can have a civil ceremony for like a hundred bucks but I'm unsure if this varies per state, please do your research based on where you plan to elope exactly. We would have had it pretty easy since it was Montgomery County, Maryland.      \n\nA batshit crazy idea we had at the height of the relationship when we weren't think rationally as madly in-love 20 year olds was her getting pregnant with my child which would make it so she could put me in a situation where I'd have to marry her and the government couldn't take issue with it, effectively allowing us to get quite far ahead at the cost of us having a baby at a point in a relationship where we had no business starting a family and also taking a gigantic risk if she were to be pregnant and I were to be forced to leave the USA. Please never go this route unless you are absolutely desperate or have the means together to raise a child and be sponsored by your spouse. We did not and if we went with this route we'd be ultra fucked because she'd then need to make even more money to be a potential sponsor.      \n\nAll that aside, once you do actually marry, in whichever (documented) way you've managed to, you are now legally their spouse and eligible to potentially be petitioned for a CR1 or IR1 green card. A CR1 (CR = Conditional Relative) is given to a spouse who has been married less than two years and vice versa. CR1 lasts for two years before you need to file an I-175 which, if approved, changes you from a \"conditional relative\" to an \"immediate relative\" (Hence the \"IR\"). While doing this, you will, once again, need to prove that you and your spouse are in a bona fide relationship but this time you should come fully stacked with everything you can to prove you two have a life together. Joint bills, joint bank account statements, proof of living together, pictures together, and the most effective evidence, birth certificates of any children you may have had together while living together in the USA. Once you are converted from CR1 to IR1 you have a green card which is valid for 10 years before needing to be renewed. This gives you more than enough time to become a naturalized citizen of the United States of America and finally be able to relax and not have to fear getting fucked over by USCIS. All the best.      \n\nI also apologise for any typos, I'm writing this on a late night, unable to sleep and wanted to share my findings to tire myself out mentally",

I just need some peace of mind to know whether or not its a possibility that this person could be deported if confronted by ICE.\n\nThey are from Venezuela. They crossed the border illegally, and were found by border patrol and taken to the holding center on the border of the US and Mexico. They were later released (I'm not sure of the exact reason) but they were allowed entry into the US and could fly inside the country. This was in 2021. Venezuela's political state is very twisted and dictatorial, so I'm assuming they applied for political asylum from their country. They've lived here since then, and have recently been approved to re enter the country with legal papers given by their lawyers. They have not received the papers yet, and have not left the country to re-enter. Knowing immigration lawyers, it will probably take months before that happens. I need to know that in their current status as immigrants if they could be deported by ICE.\n\nI need to know so I can do everything in my power to keep them safe and plan for the worst.

El estado político de Venezuela es muy retorcido y dictatorial, así que supongo que solicitaron asilo político a su país. Han vivido aquí desde entonces, y recientemente han sido aprobados para volver a entrar en el país con papeles legales dados por sus abogados. Aún no han recibido los papeles y no han salido del país para volver a entrar. Conociendo a los abogados de inmigración, probablemente pasen meses antes de que eso ocurra.

        "selftext": "I’m sharing my story hoping to attain two things: (1) informing any foreigners studying/working in USA to prevent them from making the same mistakes I did, and (2) looking for solace, suggestions, or similar stories that perhaps could help me overcome my situation. I hope this post can achieve both of those things. I also want to apologize beforehand if I’m not clear enough about the various immigration status in USA (F1, H1-B, TPS, H4, EB-2 NIW, etc.). I tried to make this post as accessible as possible, yet it’s inevitable that those that lived/living in USA have more ease to understand my situation than the rest.\n\nI’m a 26-year-old (M) Venezuelan. On 2016, I travelled to the US to study Engineering at a university in Florida, under an F1 Visa (Student). I was lucky to have received scholarships due to my academic performance in High School. On 2021, I finished my degree, with honors (Cum Laude), but without a job due to COVID + an extremely saturated Professional Market (even for an engineer). Naturally, I enrolled in a Masters in Engineering to extend my time in USA and look for job opportunities while I studied. Same university, same Immigrant Status (F1). Approximately that same year (2021), I applied for TPS (Temporary Protected Status). The reason why I did this is because literally every Venezuelan living in USA were doing so, plus I was clarified like 1,001 times that I could hold both status, F1 and TPS. For those that don’t know, TPS is similar to “Political Asylum”, and has been granted to countries that face humanitarian crisis (e.g. Afghanistan, Haiti, Ukraine, Venezuela, etc.). I spoke with an Immigration Lawyer, and assured me that I could have the TPS “on my back pocket”, while I continued my path with the F1… AS LONG AS I DID NOT APPLY FOR “WORK PERMIT” OR “TRAVEL PERMIT” UNDER TPS. I could travel under F1 (it’s a simple permit that you request from your college/university), and/or work under F1 (CPT for internships, and OPT for employment after graduation), but never do so “under TPS” since this would cause me to lose my F1 Status (Student). I listened to my lawyer and followed his instructions.\n\nThroughout my Masters program, I had to opportunity to complete an internship with a renowned multinational engineering corporation. On October 2023 (2 months before finishing my program), I received an offer for full-time employment with the same company. I had never felt so accomplished.\n\nOn February 2024, I began working with this company under OPT (Optional Practical Training). Basically, this program allows foreign students to work in USA from 1-3 years (depending on your degree) before your program is over. During this period of time, the company you work for can submit your name in a “lottery” for H1-B (Working) Visa, which allows you to work for longer, while also being a more “secure” path to get your Green Card. And that’s exactly what happened to me. My company submitted my name in the H1-B Cap Lottery and, in March 2024, I received an email stating that I was selected on the 1^(st) attempt. I felt wonderful.\n\nOn August 2024, I got legally married with my current wife (of Brazilian nationality). She went to the same university I attended, works for the same company (different fields, though), and was also selected for the H1-B Cap. We decided to schedule our wedding ceremony for May 2025, in Brazil so that all our family/loved ones could attend the ceremony. Here comes an important detail: you can have any immigrant status in USA; however, the moment you leave the country you basically lose it and need to renew it on an American Consulate. My wife and I developed a strategy: travel to Brazil on December 2024, renew our visas (basically “stamp” our H1-B, but you need to complete an interview with a Consulate Officer regardless) to be able to exit/enter the US without any issues (for our wedding ceremony). Once you get your visa “stamped”, you’re able to return to USA without any issues, whatsoever. Without the “stamp”, you cannot enter USA legally. It’s worth pointing out that, if you don’t leave the US, you don’t need to stamp/renew any visas… you just need to continue your life without getting in trouble (legal issues) and eventually (in a couple of years), you’ll probably obtain the Green Card.\n\nOn October, I received terrible news. Despite my name being selected on H1-B Cap Lottery, the Law Firm responsible for completing the processing did not submit my payment in time. “They dropped the ball”, as Americans would say. I could not believe this; it almost left me catatonic. How is it possible that a Law Firm that specializes in Immigration Services, no less, would make such blatant mistake? Do they even understand how difficult it is for your name to be selected on H1-B Cap Lottery? I began doing some digging, and it looks like everyone whose name were selected in the lottery were continuing their process without any irregularities, except for me. I spoke with HR, lawyers, and other representatives (inside and outside the company), and the verdict was always the same. “We have never seen something similar, but there’s nothing we can do since the Payment Deadline has passed”. Additionally, “your company has very strong professional ties with this Law Firm, so stay put unless you want to be laid off”. Finally, “don’t worry. We will put your name in H1-B Cap Lotteries for 2025 and 2026. For now, though, you’ll continue with your F1 (Student) Visa”.\n\nI’d already bought the tickets to travel to Brazil on December, so I decided to speak with an Immigration Lawyer (brother-in-law with one of my best friends) to determine if there was no risk in travelling to Brazil in December to stamp/renew my F1 Visa (instead of the “H1-B”). “There shouldn’t be any issues”, I was told by that man who studied Law for many years in another American University. And so, I listened to him.\n\nBy this point, some of you might already guess where this story is heading. My wife and I arrive to Brazil in late-November, and we have our interview on December 2 to renew our Visas (F1 for me, and H1-B for her). “REJECTED” was the Consulate’s decision. They didn’t even tell me why; I was just sent an email stating that “I was rejected under section 214(B) from the INA”. After doing some research, I find that this ‘section 214(B) from the INA’ states that “every applicant needs to show enough ties with their country-of-origin to prove that they have no intentions of staying in the US”. This is where I learned something I’ll never forget…\n\nThere’s two types of Immigrant Visas under US Law:\n\n1.       Dual Intent Visa – the applicants can show intentions of staying in the US without any issues (e.g. H1-B, O-1, H4, etc.).\n\n2.       Non-Immigrant Visa – the applicant needs to show enough ties with their country-of-origin to show that they have no intentions of staying in the US (e.g. F1 Visa).\n\nIn other words, if those lawyers had not “fumbled” my application (not the first word that came to mind, but let’s keep this civil), my chances of REJECTION would have dwindled significantly. With the F1 Visa, I need to prove ties with Venezuela, and I don’t have many. The only one I can think of is that my parents live there. But the rest of my family is literally spread all over the globe… Especially in the US.\n\nThis is where I begin freaking out, and I decide to schedule Virtual Consultations with 5 different Immigration Lawyers… Lo and behold, each lawyer has a different opinion on “what happened” and “how to proceed”. The last lawyer I spoke to advised me to apply again for the F1, this time proving ties with Brazil. Although I’m not Brazilian, I have PLENTY of ties with BR. From age 3 to 6, I lived in Brazil since my dad was transferred due to his job roles at the time. I speak Portuguese. My sister was born in Brazil. I have Brazilian Documents (more like an expired Brazilian ID, but I have it nonetheless!). And, of course, my wife is Brazilian. I also speak with my representatives from my company, and they advised me to do the same (my ability to work with them is contingent on me maintaining my F1 Status). So, I say “screw it” and scheduled a 2^(nd) interview to renew my F1.\n\n“REJECTED” again. This time, however, I was given reasons… The fact that I had applied for a TPS (Temporary Protected Status) back in 2021 shows that I have intentions of staying in the US, EVEN IF I DON’T HOLD THIS STATUS ANYMORE. Cause here is the thing, by having left the US without asking for TPS Travel Permit (aka “Advanced Parole”) I automatically ‘abandoned’ this status. What the US Consulate cares about, nonetheless, is that I applied and held that status (regardless of ‘when’ and ‘what’ my current status is)… Too many links with USA.\n\nNow, I’m currently in Brazil pondering about my life. I’ve spoken to various lawyers and been told that the ONLY OPTION I have is applying for a H4 Visa (aka “Dependent Visa”, due to being married to someone holding an H1-B Visa) so I can return to USA… Here’s the catch, though. I cannot work under an H4. This Visa does not allow for “employment”, it is merely a Visa that permits holders to enter and live in the US. BUT I CANNOT WORK. The other option would be to return to Venezuela and start from scratch… which, if you have any degree of familiarity with Venezuela’s sociopolitical situations, it’s a terrible idea. Many lawyers are also warning me that procuring this H4 Visa won’t be easy, especially after having to prior rejections in the previous months. These rejections were concerning a different visa, F1, but they were rejections nevertheless. Other lawyers are telling me that H4 is a Dual-Intent Visa, so I should not have any issues getting approved.\n\nBut, losing my job? A little more than a month ago, everything was going fine, and now I’m fighting to return to US to do absolutely nothing? What if my H4 Applications gets rejected? MY wife will travel to US, and I will have to return to Venezuela (which is basically “game over”, especially with so many years of study and work where I always gave my 101%). It’s as if the world, my life, is slowly escaping me and there is nothing I can do. It feels as if 2024 was the year where lawyers f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* me up; first, with the H1-B Application and lastly (different lawyer) assuring me that nothing wrong would have happened if I came to Brazil to renew my F1.\n\nI’m not sure how to conclude this post, but I hope this serves as a warning for all foreigners studying/working in US. Always lawyer up (with good lawyers, mind you) before taking any decision that could compromise your legal status. If you have TPS + another status, DO NOT LEAVE THE US. For as many years as you might have lived in USA (8-years, in my case), always know that your legal status is hanging by a thread until you obtain a Green Card (or, its equivalent document, in whichever country you’re residing).\n\nAnd for those with experience in similar situations… What would you recommend me? I’ve heard that Brazilian Consulates are extremely picky when it comes to renewing visas. Maybe travelling to another country to apply for F1 again (in my case, Colombia or Mexico are two countries that might be more familiar with Venezuela’s situation). I’m willing to risk it all, if that’s the case. I’ve also heard that EB-2 NIW (similar to a “Talent Visa”, for individuals of exceptional abilities and holding advanced degrees) is another option, which I’m currently looking into. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nThank you, and I hope you have/had great holidays with your loved ones.",

        "selftext": "Hello, redditors,\n\nI'm 28, from Bosnia and Herzegovina (Eastern Europe), and I have always dreamed of moving to the USA to work and live there. I hold a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from my home country. For the past 2.5 years, I’ve worked as a project manager outside of engineering due to limited opportunities in my field in Bosnia. Given the challenging situation in my country regarding work, pay, safety, and overall life satisfaction, I want to pursue my dream of moving to the USA.\n\nI have saved $10k and can borrow an additional $20k from my family, so I would have around $30k to start.\n\n*Some options that I'm considering:*\n\n- F1 Visa (Master’s in the USA): My GPA is 3.5, so I’m confident I could get into a U.S. master’s program. My plan would be to finish the degree, work under OPT, and aim for H1B sponsorship. Civil engineering is currently in demand, though finances might be tight.\n\n- J1 Visa (Internship/Trainee): I could get a J1 visa via a local agency for about $15k, though I’d need to be enrolled in a master’s program in my home country. This route would allow me to work right away and potentially seek sponsorship.\n\n- H2B Visa: I could apply for seasonal construction work and possibly extend it for up to 3 years while pursuing an EB-3. This option has lower costs and allows me to start working right away.\n\n- EB-3 Visa: Some agencies offer this option directly, though it involves lower pay and challenging work. The upside is a more direct path to a green card, but it’s costly (around $20k) and requires a waiting period.\n\n\n*Some things to take into account :* \n\n- EB2 and EB3 waiting times are relatively short for my country.\n\n- I'm also participating in the visa lottery every year.\n\n- I don’t want to go to Europe or other countries. I've been there, and there are many reasons why I don't want to go back (i.e., language barriers, limited opportunities, cultural differences, etc.). Canada would be my last resort, but my first goal is to try my best for the USA.\n\n- I have no intention of doing anything illegal, especially regarding immigration. Some people I've asked for advice told me I'm overcomplicating things and suggested I simply come to the U.S. and “figure it out from there.” Others have even suggested overstaying a tourist visa, seeking asylum, or crossing the border from Mexico, claiming, \"that's just how it works\" and \"you'll get papers fastest that way\" (???). Anyway, I'm not comfortable with any similar options.\n\n- The same goes for marriage. If I meet someone I see myself with in the long term and it happens out of love, great. However, I don’t want to date solely for my immigration status, and I’m not planning to use marriage as a way to achieve it, so I don't want to rely on this option. \n\n\n*My question :*\nIn your opinion, what would be my best option for getting a foot in the door and possibly staying and immigrating? Are there any other options that might come to mind that I’m not considering?",

We arrived via ferry from Belize on Wednesday and have only be granted to stay until 11th November and we want to stay longer.\n\nHaving read similar posts I understand this cannot be changed unless we do a visa run which means we have to leave the country for 72hrs! The issue is that we already visited Belize and Guatemala, but given our location - now in Merida for the next 9 days these seem to be the only option without a ridiculous amount of travelling or expensive flight!\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on which border crossing would be best in terms of limiting travelling / travel cost and offer somewhere worthwhile visiting? On the Guatemala side we have already done Tikal and Xela.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I've read the directions for the CRBA and I am quite confused. \n\nThe CRBA form says to list \"precise periods of time in the United States.\" How does the US government expect you to remember the exact day you returned to the US if you took multiple foreign trips as a kid and you don't have your old passports?\n\nDuring summer vacation in elementary and middle school, I would sometimes go overseas to visit family. I don't remember which specific years I went overseas and which I didn't. Neither do my parents. \n\nSince the form asks for \"precise periods of time in the United States\" as opposed to estimates, I am a bit uncomfortable with swearing that everything is correct, given the uncertainty around the exact dates I was in the USs. Instead, can I just write a statement on a separate sheet of paper saying something like\n\n> Declaration on physical presence\n\n> I, u/Silent-Sentence-9563, born on MM/DD/YYYY in _________, _______, USA with United States passport number XXXXXXXXX declare:\n\n> 1. I physically attended elementary, middle, and high school in _____, _______, USA for the academic years 20XX-20XX as evidenced by my attached school transcripts. As my state mandates that students have 180 days of instructions, I estimate I was physically present for a total of at least 1620 days in the United States between 20XX-20XX academic years and at least 540 days in my 10th, 11th, and 12th grade academic years.\n> 2. I attended University1 in _______, ______, USA for the academic years 20XX-20XX as evidence by my attacheed  transcripts from University1.

Thus, I estimate to have been physically present in the United States for a total of at least 180 days during the academic years of 20XX-20XX.\n> 4.

And again he has lived in Mexico for 5 years and obtained his permanent residency. \n\nCan anyone clarify if he really needs to return to Mexico and fulfill the two-year residency requirement? \n\nAre there any options available for him given our circumstances?

I registered the first 2 kids' births at the consulate (CRBA), and subsequently got their passports. Kid 3 was born during Covid, so I did it in the opposite order; we got his passport without the CRBA. Now, I am finally getting the paperwork together to apply for his report of birth abroad. I know, this is not technically needed given that he already has his US passport, but there are certain bureaucratic contexts in which I have found it useful to have the CRBA in addition to the passports for the other kids.\n\nThe [state.gov](http://state.gov) website, the passport application process, and the consular staff have frequently disagreed with each other about the requirement re US presence. They frequently use \"presence\" and \"residence\" interchangeably. Given this, when I applied for kiddo #1, I prepared two versions of the form in advance of our visit. The first listed the periods my wife lived in the US (easy: a single period right up to the time I whisked her away in her 20's). The second listed the periods my wife was physically present in the US. This second form was painful to assemble, because she was on a team that represented the US at international competitions from the time she was an early teen. She travelled internationally ALL THE TIME. Plus, we travel to the US frequently for business. That form had more than 30 \"periods of presence\" in the US. I used her passport stamps and the results of a freedom of information request to DHS to get her travel history as best I could.\n\nI showed both forms to the consular staff, and asked them which one they wanted. The fellow laughed at me, and took the shorter form.\n\nFor kid #2, I brought only the shorter form.\n\nWhen applying for passport for kind #3, I sent only the shorter form. They sent a follow-up requesting more information, which again conflated residence and presence, and we pointed this out via a letter, and they eventually issued the passport. No problem.\n\nNow I'm finally getting around to applying for CRBA for kid #3. Now, they have a fancy web interface. Now, THAT form does NOT conflate presence and residence. In fact, they explicitly give an example of a person taking a brief trip ending one period of presence, and beginning another.\n\nKid #1 is 7 years older than kid #3, so I now have to assemble another 7 years worth of travel history. I'd bet there will be another 20 or 30 trips to the US, some as short as a couple of hours, e.g. to apply for kid #3's passport (had to do this at a post office). One trip literally lasted only 30 minutes to do a Nexus interview. Obviously we don't count the times spent in the water over the border without landing, or in US airspace with origin and destination airports outside the US. But this is all so dumb.\n\nThis web form is PAINFUL. You can't type the dates, you have to click around in a horrible UI. You can't type the name of a state like a normal drop-down box.\n\nI'm told there's now a web portal where I can get her travel history from DHS, so at least I may not have to file another FOA request.\n\nI yell to the universe: the US law requires only a certain minimal amount of time in the US at particular life periods in order for kid #3 to qualify for US citizenship. Her period of physical presence #1 covers that requirement. Every piece of data entry, which will likely take a whole day, is not actually needed to satisfy this law. But, the form (but not the law) requires every period of presence up to the birth of the kiddo. So none of this data entry is actually necessary.\n\nNo doubt others on this forum have far more painful experiences. and this may land poorly. But on the off chance this can be a source of commiseration, thank you in advance for your warm wishes :)",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\n I have been thinking about how each region and locality of the US could be allowed to select (with flexible requirements and own rules for rejecting/accepting) and get more people to work and live as they need. Of course, this is given only when decision on its acceptance is given by the federal government. Also, depending on each program's rules, nominees could be able to bring their spouses and single children under 21 without any derivative dependents (if not, probably some nonimmigrant visas should be made widely available not for just the proposed pathway nominees, but for all LPR in general).\n\n So, my proposal would allocate 500-1000 nominees each year (maybe same flat limit for each state or varying per state population) to each US state, so that they can run their programs and fill in some crucial vacancies as needed. The unused part would not propagate further to any immigration path. Each state would be running an official website with all the info and terms.\n\n Next, each county and county-equivalent, as well as each Native American reservation would be getting 30-100 (allocation options as for states) slots each year for selecting and putting immigrants how and where they want. Additionally, states or feds (for reservations) could add some limited number of add-on allocation numbers for discretion of these 2nd level administrative units. Plus, they could simplify finding info about them by adding it to the state's website they are located in. Reservations could be all demonstrating their programs in another website. As an optional feature, in case approved by USCIS and DOL, when applicable, the localities could transfer their limits to one another, but none of them could get transferred more than their original limit.\n\n The character of each nomination could be contractual, with possible terms of first living in the specified place/area and working in a certain occupation or field for up to 5 years, separate terms of renewability of nonimmigrant \"bridge\" visas, although eventually every nomination would need to be allowing LPR if no serious deviations are seen. Further, to accommodate dependent family members in case needed, exceeding the limit by up to 10% for county, county-equivalent, and reservation programs each year could be allowed with the withdrawal of that number from either own local nomination limit or state limit, as agreed by respective authorities.\n\n Further, given meeting some federal standards for entry clearance, the state or local government-appointed personnel would approve or reject case-by-case every application (say, a video-call or in some cases even some live meeting with some representation-authorized persons outside US could be allowed). That approval then becomes the basis for going to the consulate/embassy to get nonimmigrant \"bridge\" visas or immigrant new arrival visas; and similarly in USCIS offices in the US. I think the administrative units must be free to limit eligibility by country of birth/citizenship, but never by religion (of course excluding radical beliefs), race, or ethnicity. Some more details would need to be determined as well, of course.\n\n In summary, this outline would have these programs invite up to 25-50 thousand people annually for states, and 104,040-348600 for 2nd level administrative units; a cumulative total is 154,040-398,600. I am pretty sure that if enacted, these limits would not be used by even 80% that often. Some measure of staged introduction (lower limits in the first few years) could be used as well. Also, required are specific universal, but not too hefty regulations for employers and organizations that co-operate with these state and local immigration programs.\n\n Please, consider writing your opinion about this. I think the higher-end limit is too much, if utilized close to full capacity.\n\n  \n TL;DR: I have an outline of a would-be immigration system that would, with a cumulative annual limit of 154 to about 400 thousand people yearly, allow US states, counties, county-equivalents, and Native American reservations nominate people for immigration.",

        "selftext": "I am sorry if this is against the rules. I don't know Reddit but I'm not getting answers anywhere else.\n\nMy parents are from Mexico but I believe got amnesty in the 80s though I'm fuzzy on the details. Regardless, they absolutely are naturalized and they told me and my four siblings that we were all born here in Texas and are 100% American citizens. I personally have never had any issues and my siblings, minus the brother in question, have said the same. We have gotten copies of our birth certificates, social security cards, gotten drivers licenses and passports with no issue other than the usual annoyances of those processes. We've had jobs without issue.\n\nSo, anyway, my oldest brother has gotten into some bad trouble over theft and burglaries and apparently there's an immigration attorney involved.\n\nI asked my parents about it and they said it was just a mistake, that he was racially profiled but I looked up his court documents and it comes up a lot. \n\nIt says WORK_WITH_IMMIGRA_ATTY on many of these documents and I'm thinking it's not a mistake if it's multiple times on multiple dates. And that's what I'm asking for clarification on.\n\nIs it at all possible that it was a mistake? Could there be any reason an immigration attorney would consult with a citizen? If not, does this necessarily mean he's undocumented? He was born in 1985 and it is my understanding that children at the time were also naturalized but could there be some issue there?\n\nI'm sorry if I sound naive, ignorant, or desperate. Up until this point, I honestly had no reason to be knowledgeable about immigration. My family is heavily Americanized. We never spoke Spanish in the house (I don't know it at all!) and my parents unfortunately have an \"above it all\" mentality about our Mexican heritage, which always made me somewhat uncomfortable but that's another story for another day.\n\nI can't understand why he would have that on there if he is a citizen. I don't know why he wouldn't be a citizen in the first place or why he didn't become one by now if he wasn't.\n\nIt doesn't make sense and my parents are very tight-lipped about it. They have boxed us out completely on the subject and I apparently can't contact my brother in jail because I'm not on his list.\n\nI just know they're more worried than I've ever seen them in my life. My mom barely eats and just stays in bed all the time. My dad retired in 2019 but started working again because of the legal expenses. Maybe it's just the 5-10 years he's likely facing in prison but given everything else, I have this gut feeling that it's a lot more than that.  They're both so tired and I fear this will kill them, honestly, but they're boxing everyone out and won't let us help. Or maybe we can't do anything.\n\nThis has been a very troubling experience and I need to do something about this impending feeling of doom I have. \n\nAny help on this is appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Good Afternoon, r/immigration, \n\nBasically, the title summarizes it pretty well. I am 22 years old, having been born and raised in Germany to an American father and German mother. I am fairly certain I did not automatically obtain citizenship at birth due to my dad not meeting the residency requirements (5 years in total LIVING in the US, with two of the years being completed after the 14th birthday). He never filed a CRBA, or form N600K. Still, he is a US citizen, having and having kept ONLY the US Citizenship (despite living in Germany for close to 50 years).\n\nMy Grandfather, however, would very much be meeting the requirements (He lived in the USA for about 40 years before my Dad was born, and about 5 years just after), and as stated in the Instructions for form N600K, this would also count, given I can prove my Dads dependency on my Grandpa (which I also can). The problem here is that I am now over 18 years of age, which means form N600K doesn't apply to me anymore. Another important factor would be that my grandpa was in the Air Force for a pretty long time, with this also being the reason for him moving to Germany 5 years after adopting my Dad. We have multiple files documenting his service and exceptional performance during these years, on North American AND \"foreign\" US soil (\"Foreign\" as in the barracks here in Germany).\n\nI am currently residing in Germany, but I'm very much planning on moving to the US sooner than later. I believe I do have everything it should take to be granted citizenship / prove I am eligible for citizenship, my only REAL issue is the fact that theres no Form to fill out as I am, as stated before, resident in Germany, over the Age of 18 and have never lived in the USA myself.\n\nMy question now is the following: What are my options? How, where, and to whom can I prove my eligibility for citizenship based on the factors I just listed? Are there any forms I can fill out (except for N-600, N-600K, and DS-2029, as I don't meet the eligibility requirements for these)? Are there any resources for cases as mine? Sadly, the two USCIS agents I talked to weren't of much help, which is why I am asking here. If you made it this far, I appreciate you taking time to read through this, and if you have any answers/tips/ideas where to start, I'd greatly appreciate you telling me either through the comments or PMs. If you need any more information to be able to help me, please let me know as well.\n\nThank you very much and have a great rest of your day, \n\nJake",

        "selftext": "Hi, I am a 24 year old male born and raised in Canada. My mother is Canadian and my dad has dual citizenship (Canadian and American), in which I know that he has had American citizenship since birth. I have recently been looking into how likely I would be to acquire dual citizenship through transmission, and I feel like I have a claim at citizenship due to my father being listed on my birth certificate. I believe he does have the physical presence requirements as well, as far as I know he was born and raised in the U.S until he was at least 16-18 which is before I was born.\n\nMy main question is, since my father is basically estranged and we have little to no relationship, do I need to get in contact with him to sign the affidavit of parentage and obtain evidence that he is a u.s citizen as well as evidence of physical presence? Also, would my birth certificate with his name on it count as evidence of parentage/legitimation, and child support payments as proof of financial support?\n\n  \nAlso, how would I check if I have been a u.s citizen since birth, would I have been given a CRBA if this is the case? My dad lived in the U.S for at least 5 years before I was born, so I think I should have qualified for that as well but i'm not too sure on the process of finding out.\n\n  \nThank you!",

I’ve called the Airport, American Airlines(the only flight available for the specific days that’s not a 10 hour flight plus) and the Mexican embassy in Mexico City and all of them have given me little information or referred to websites with .gov that also are vague but I’ve learned that the border agent will have to decide him or herself and I’m just worried about coming back into the U.S. also we were going to bring my Mexican passport with my maiden name, my Mexican birth certificate, my social security card with my married name, our marriage certificate and Texas drivers license sadly I’m still in process of becoming a citizen and can’t get an United States passport in time, also the lady that helped us with this process tells us not to worry we should be fine but I’ve read/heard of some bad stories so we just want to try everything we can, any info will help!",

        "selftext": "My friend is a foreign national named \"Susan\" who was in a long-term relationship with a US citizen named \"Andy.\" They were not married.\n\nAndy did live for at least 5 years, 2 after 14 in the US.\n\nThey had two sons, twins. \n\nUnfortunately, Andy died of COVID 3 months after they were born back in 2020.\n\nAfter the death, Susan pushed herself into work and advanced a lot in her career. Now, because of her success, her company wants to transfer her to the US on an L1 visa. The I-129 looks set to be approved in the coming weeks.\n\nNow, to get the twins to the US they face a few issues.\n\n1. Proving biological relationship: Birth certificate has Andy's name. But the closest blood relatives of Andy who are living are Andy's mother (grandmother) and Andy's full brother (uncle). I am not sure if DNA can prove the biological relationship to 99.99 the US consulate may require.\n\n2. Legitimation/acknowledgment of paternity/court adjudication of paternity: The twins would only be legitimated if the parents married. Andy did not acknowledge paternity. He \"declared\" it. Thus, he is on the birth certificate. He did it in the government office where people usually do this. However, we are not sure whether it was \"under oath.\" There is no \"subscribed and sworn to\" in the acknowledgment, but it is signed and stamped by the foreign governmental authority. I should note that the US embassy in the country actually requests this statement when doing CRBA. The other twist is, he did this before the twins were born. As far as court adjudication of paternity, there were no court proceedings for the sole purposes of establishing paternity. Rather, it was in probate, that the foreign court just assumed Andy is the father of the twins because his name was on the birth certificate.\n\nGiven the fact that it is not clear-cut if the children were legitimated and whether the acknowledgment was done properly to get citizenship by US law, is it better if they just straight apply for L2 visa and not waste $100 for the CRBA?",

        "selftext": "Sorry for long post.\n\nI am a US citizen living outside the US in country A and my partner/girlfriend is a citizen of country B.\n\nAt the end of June, we had a baby who was born in country B.\n\nNow we have started to look into the appointment process for CRBA and here the US embassy doesn't have appointments till late August. They tell us if we have urgent travel back to the US, we need to send them an email.  There are few problems with this:\n\n1. We don't have urgent travel back to the US, but back to country A because of job reasons. We **both** need to be back in country A by end of August. Her job starts at end of August and my paternity leave ends.\n\n2. For the urgent travel request, they expect us to send them a booked travel itinerary. This is odd considering that when foreign nationals apply for visas, the DoS says not to buy any tickets till you have the visa. I would expect similar logic to apply to passports. A passport is even more fundamental to travel than a visa because you can fly many places without a visa depending on which country's citizenship you hold. Why would you buy tickets without a passport?\n\n3. Problem 2 isn't so much of a problem right now because our baby can use country B's passport to travel to country A and get a residence permit in country A. However, we both have work trips to New York to meet clients beginning of September. She has a B1/B2 visa which is fine to use because she is just meeting clients. But we are not sure if we can get a US passport in time for our baby to enter the US by September.\n\nNow, applying for a CRBA from country A will take even more processing time because kid was born in country B so I am not sure CRBA and passport will be finished by September.\n\nIn this situation, looking at our options it seems they are:\n\n1. Get a B1/B2 visa in country A for the baby using visa interview waiver program since the applicant is a minor and a parent holds a B1/B2 visa (aka my gf). Those seem to be faster than CRBA and passport because appointments are within like 14 calendar days. \n\n2. I fly to Mexico with our baby (passport from country B allows visa free travel there). GF flies and enters on B1/B2. My gf, me, and baby show up at the land border to make sure CBP doesn't think I am abducting baby and so they can do a DNA test if they don't believe the birth certificate and we figure it out there.\n\nSo how can I get our baby a US passport before September?",

However, my wife still has not received any email, let alone a DHL tracking number. Is this normal? If we don't have a tracking number by this Wednesday, we're going to write to the relevant email (since the page says to follow up if no number has been sent after 5 business days).**\n\nHi all!\n\nI'm seeking some insights about the current processing times for a Border Crossing Card (BCC) renewal. Here’s the situation:\n\nI'm a U.S. citizen residing in Mexico, and my wife, who is Mexican, recently had her BCC renewal appointment. It took place on June 26, 2024, in Mexico City, and so far, we haven't received any updates.\n\nI understand that the typical processing time is around 8 to 12 weeks, so under normal circumstances, I wouldn't be too concerned about the lack of news at this stage. However, something has made me wonder about the lack of follow-up so far.\n\n**Comparison to My Half-Brother's Experience:**\n\nMy half-brother and his family, all Mexican citizens without dual citizenship, had their BCC appointment in April of this year. Despite several previous denials, they were approved within a week of their appointment. During their interview, they were informed of their approval on the spot.\n\nNotably, my father, who is also my half-brother's father, had requested assistance from our Senator (Patty Murray, of Washington state), asking for special consideration to help my half-brother and his family get approved in light of their previous denials. I would suspect this intervention played a role in their swift approval process.\n\n**Factors I'm Considering:**\n\n1. **Application Timing:**\n   * My half-brother and his family submitted their application over a year ago, potentially allowing consular officials more time to pre-review their documentation.\n   * In contrast, my wife received her renewal appointment just one month after submitting her application, which might not have provided enough time for a thorough review.\n2. **Senatorial Intervention:**\n   * My half-brother's case had the added benefit of the senatorial support mentioned above, which we did not seek for my wife's application. Could this have expedited their process?\n3. **Renewal vs. First-Time Applications:**\n   * Does anyone know if renewals typically take longer than first-time applications? Could the shorter interval between application submission and the appointment for renewals be a factor in longer processing times?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that my wife previously held a 10-year BCC with a spotless record, which expired in November 2023, I'm curious if the lack of news on her renewal is within the norm or if there might be other factors at play.\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

        "selftext": "Edit: She went to her interview and she passed.  Some of you numbskulls think you know better but haven't even read my post and began to comment things you didn't understand when you failed to read my post.  We have turned in all evidence prior to the interview. At the interview, the interviewer had all the information that we provided beforehand, therefore only asked to see her green card.  I'm sure you all had a hard time with your process because you couldn't read a 3 paragraph post without misinterpreting it.  To those that did read my post and gave me good advice: thank you.  The notice to appear was generic, and did not pertain to my case. I made sure that all required documents were submitted 3 months prior to the interview.  Nothing was needed, just pass the civics and English test, which took her all of 3 minutes of the interview and she was approved for citizenship.\n\n\n\nWe were married in Mexico back in February of 2013, and she emigrated to the US in 2015. We don't know what happened to the original marriage certificate. We had it when we applied for her green card and for the citizenship, but somehow it got lost.  All we have is a copy that has a translation overlay over it, so the words are in English.  It also came with its certification of translation.\n\nWe filled out the N-400 online and turned in all the required documents with the application online, so they should have access to the copies.  The interview was vague on what to bring other than her green card, and information online is very unreliable.  I turned in our tax info, our rental agreement, to show that she is paying taxes and that we live together. Everything that the N-400 asked, we provided it.  Why is the interview asking to bring this information with us? It seems like generic information. I will be going with her and providing my birth certificate and passport and Federal government ID card, in case they ask me to step inside and to swear testimony and ask relationship questions.  I am so anxious and worrying about everything.\n\nAm I missing something?  She smashed the 100 civics questions (2008) that I tested her on, and her English is good enough.  She isn't a terrorist, an insane anarchist-activist, or a criminal.  She has lived in the US for 9 years, never committed a crime, doesn't have anti-American views, attends church, pays taxes, and is a good citizen.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nMy girlfriend lives in a country where divorcing a spouse takes a long time. It requires a lengthy separation if there is no mutual consent. In the middle we moved in with each other and she had our child.\n\nWe are in the middle of legal proceedings to establish that I am the father and a DNA test has been taken. However, it will be some more time until a final order of paternity is done and I am declared the legal father, after which there will be a custody order.\n\nGiven all this, I am not sure if my child is eligible for US citizenship. When my child was born, his legal parents were my girlfriend and her soon-to-be-ex-husband. So the child is considered as born in-wedlock. Then we go to INA 301 which determines US citizenship for those born in-wedlock and it says that one of the parents must be a US citizen, which of course makes sense. When I looked at the decisions of *Scales v INS* it says\n\n> The INA does expressly require a blood relationship between a person claiming citizenship and a citizen father, if the person is born out of wedlock.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1409(a)(1) (setting forth legitimation requirements for a person born out of wedlock to a citizen father).   This provision does not apply to Petitioner, however, because he was born to parents who were married at the time of his birth.\n\nSo does this mean that since my child **at birth** had two legal parents who were married to each other, INA 309 cannot be applied to my child and that only INA 301 applies? In which case, my child does not get citizenship because INA 301 requires at least one parent to be a US citizen, and neither of the legal parents at birth were US citizens? INA 301 applies to legitimate children and my child is legitimate as he was born when his legal parents **at birth** were married to each other. The only thing is, one of his legal parents was not the actual biological father.",

We have parents living outside the US that are foreign citizens.\n\nWe are considering doing the petition to get a green card for our parents and I have a few questions:\n\n1. [Various sources seem to state that ](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-long-does-family-based-immigration-to-the-us-take/#:~:text=The%20median%20processing%20time%20for,months%20between%202013%20and%202023.&text=Home%20%2F%20Population%20and%20society%20%2F%20Articles,immigration%20to%20the%20US%20take%3F)it takes much shorter to get a parent a green card than e.g. siblings - for example around 1-2 years - is this correct? \n\n2. Our parents are currently not considering moving to the US but we were thinking we should get the process of the green card going in any case given the length of time it could take to process. Once they get the green card would it just be possible then for them to come into the US every now and then (e.g. once or twice a year) to \"keep the green card active\" without having to apply for a re-entry permit and can we do that indefinitely until they are ready to settle here permanently? Which may be several years down the line \n\n3. My wife's mother is remarried - does that mean that only her mother (who is her mother by birth) can apply for the green card but not her husband (we consider him like a father - but he is not her birth father) ? Does he need to apply separately through her as a spouse? I wouldn't want to split them up for any long period of time obviously \n\n4. Once they have the green card and reside here permanently. Can they eventually also become US citizens? For us it was just over 5 years from receiving our green card to citizenship. Would it be the same for them ?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Now, he (a year and a half old) receives therapy, which is extremely taxing for my husband and me. I suffer from Lupus and am in constant pain due to flares.\n\nI am originally from Peru. My family had to leave the country because we were not safe, especially after an earthquake destroyed a city, making life difficult for my parents. We had to leave to preserve our lives.\n\nMy husband is from Mexico and also had to escape due to drug cartels. Since he lived near the border with a permit, the cartels threatened him to become a drug mule or die. This forced him to flee the country. He has been in the U.S. for more than ten years now.\n\nIt has been more than five years since I came to the U.S. I met my husband here, and that’s how we had our baby. We are a family. Is there a chance of applying for asylum? Will the fact that my child needs special attention and that I need to be with him somehow help our case?\n\nI contacted an attorney for an asylum consultation, and they quoted me $500 just for him to hear my case. I’m not sure if this is worthwhile or if we even have a possibility of success. We are afraid of trying and then having to go back, as not only our lives are in danger, but also my baby’s.\n\nThank you",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'll start off by saying I am getting a lawyer due to the complexity of the case but I'm looking for advice / questions to ask on how to address an immigration case involving my parents, both natives of Mexico with a long history in the U.S., but facing challenges due to past legal issues and misinformation. \n\nHere’s a brief overview:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Clients:** My parents, who have two adult children who are U.S. citizens (ages 21 and 30).\n* **History:** They arrived in the U.S. in November 1989. They were involved in removal proceedings in 2004 due to unauthorized presence and represented themselves after being misled by notario fraud.\n* **Current Status:** The judge in 2004 ordered voluntary departure for my mother and removal for my father (who had a prior removal and returned following an expedited removal order). The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed these decisions.\n* **Additional Info:** \n   * They have been in the U.S. continuously since their respective arrivals (my mother since 1989, my father since 1999 after a brief departure 10 days in which he received the Expedited Removal Order). \n   * [The California Bar had taken possession of their files from the notario as part of a fraud case and was returned to them in 2018.](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/state-bar-helps-clients-of-bogus-immigration-law-practice#:~:text=On%20April%2010%2C%20Bonilla%20pleaded,to%20additional%20fines%20and%20penalties) I barely came across the letter from the Bar and seek help. They had at the time of the letter gone to a lawyer who told them to wait as Immigration Reform was possible soon (lol) where my father would not have to serve the bar..\n      *  [Since then USCIS has mentioned bars may be served in the United Stated. ](https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/USCIS%20%26%20BIA%20Affirm%20Three-%20and%20Ten-Year%20Unlawful%20Presence%20Bars%20Can%20Run%20in%20the%20US.pdf)\n\n**Desired Outcome:**\n\nWe wish to explore all possible legal avenues to allow either them to remain in the U.S. legally and adjust their status, potentially under I-130 petitions, as both qualify for immediate visas with U.S. citizen children over 21.\n\n**Main Questions:**\n\n1. **Reopening the Case:** What are the prospects and procedures for potentially reopening my father's case based on ineffective counsel due to notario fraud? What evidence would be required?\n2. **Waivers and Legal Barriers:** What specific waivers (e.g., I-601A, I-212, Form I-485) are necessary for each parent, considering their past immigration history and current status?\n3. **Legal Strategies:** Are there particular legal considerations or strategies that would be effective in navigating their complex situation, especially given the permanent bar and voluntary departure issues? \n\nAny insights, advice, or recommendations for legal resources and immigration experts who specialize in similar cases would be deeply appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",

As I did more research I realized I wanted to work specifically on the US/Mexico border as it is currently a major issue there. The problem is that I have an undocumented parent and was wondering if you guys know if this would completely stop my chance of getting a job in Homeland Security. I am trying to fix papers for her but because there was a mistake on my birth certificate that has to get fixed first.  Thanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "I (27M US citizen) met my wife (27F Mexican Citizen) in Texas while she was there ilegally. She entered legally with a tourist visa and a 6 month permit and she had been there 3 years by the time we met in 2017. After dating and living together over a year, we got engaged. After meeting with an immigration lawyer and getting bad advice, we got on a plane and traveled out of the US to her home country of Mexico. We planned to travel together to the US/Mexico border crossing at Laredo Tx with a K1 visa in order to enter legally, get married and live the rest of our life together. However, due to a break in at our apartment back home, I had to fly back to Texas while my fiancé drove up with a family member. When she arrived at the border, my fiancé was asked about the flight she took out of the US two weeks prior and was of course given a 5 year ban from entering the US. \n\n5 years later, we've been married about 5 years, have a 3 year old son born in Mexico, and another child on the way. My only real question is, after serving her deportation and being married the whole time to an american citizen, can she apply for her Green Card without the help of a lawyer? Can I fill out the I-130 form and the 601 waiver and handle all of that on my own and save the almost $10k every lawyer wants to charge to to just file the paperwork. I have spoken to multiple lawyers and they all pretty much admit that they cannot do anything to expedite the process and wont be present to represent her in any interview. Why should we pay the lawyer instead of doing it all myself like when I filled out the eCRBA for my son?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Can I apply for my wife's Green Card without the help of a lawyer after she has served a 5 year deportation?

        "selftext": "Ok, so this is a bit of a unique situation, because my son was born in the foreign country where I live, via donor and isn’t genetically related to me, and the country where I live doesn’t recognize my marriage. However, turns out I was able to pass my US citizenship on to him in the end, so that leads me to this question:\n\nI entered the U.S. last year with my son (he was two months old) and he had a foreign passport and an ESTA. My partner (wife as recognized in US) who gave birth to him also accompanied me and she came in with the same situation, foreign passport and ETSA for herself. At the time I remember wondering if my son would actually qualify to be a U.S. Citizen, but hadn’t completely thought it through.  I guess I had doubts because the country I live in doesn’t recognize him as my son; they view my partner as a single parent. My partner is a nonresident alien to the US. \n\nAnyhow, since then, and after checking with the US embassy, etc. that it was OK even though I’m not a bio parent, I realized I could get a CRBA for my son and an American Passport. I have done so and he currently holds a US Passport now. \n\nI know that US Citizens by birth are required to use a US Passport when entering the US, and I plan to do it from here on out. We actually have plans to visit the US soon.  \n\nIs there going to be an issue that he entered with an ESTA last time? The ESTA is actually still valid currently. \n\nI also believe that the law that allows me to transfer citizenship to my son (in the case of not being the bio parent) - apparently this law is also fairly new and people weren’t able to do it in the past. It honestly wasn’t something I expected at first (sadly, I’m quite used to the lack of recognition in my current country of residence. I also have a son who I gave birth to myself and he was not given citizenship of the country where he was born…so I guess I was a little pessimistic about it at first). \n\nIf any immigration officer asks me about it going through, I plan to simply answer honestly. \n\nIf anyone has any insight on this I’d appreciate info or advice.  \n",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for anonymity Sorry for the long post, but I feel most of the info is relevant, and it’s been a long journey, and it’s not over yet  \nMe (Us Citizen) any my now wife (Mexican citizen) are living in Mexico City but want to move to the US in a couple years. Here’s the situation. We met through a friend almost 6 years ago. Dated for awhile, She had got her B1/B2 visa and every few months we would fly to visit. Sometimes she would come her, sometimes I would go there. We decided to go for the k-1 fiancé and K-2 visa for her daughter (19 at the time) things were taking time as was expected, and everything went through and even got to the interview at the embassy. This is where it all fell apart. 20-ish years prior, she was in the US illegally. This was known and well established knowledge. The US knew it from the B1/B2 (we learn the 10 year forgiveness rule) the lawyer knew it. But, she also had brought her then 6 month old daughter with her. we had told the lawyer, but nothing came of it. We thought we were clear and this was just another stepping stone. The interviewer learned of the daughter’s situation, and it was determined that this was helping another human into the USA, and didn’t fall under the 10 year rule. They suggested to file a waiver to be forgiven of this, and seemed reasonable. Although we were obviously devastated  \nWe filed the visa within days. At the time, the wait time was 6-8 months, which was a reasonable gamble as 6 months and the daughter would still be under 21 and still a dependent, 8 months would be too long. Well, the estimated 6-8 turned into an estimated 28 months! Stupid covid. At that point, we decided that we couldn’t wait another 2.5 years-ish. We tried to get it expedited, but none of that worked. So we decided that I would move to Mexico. And get married there. We didn’t want it reach the 5 year mark. So I sold everything (I’m not rich but any stretch of the imagination, but I was Ok here, no debt besides the house (very small) and car. I sold everything and left for Mexico.  \nWe got married in April and I got my temporary residency card, and everything is great. I was still periodically checking on the waiver status, although we had all but given up on that since I had moved and the timeframe never changed. Then one day in September, I receive an email from our lawyer that the waiver was approved! We didn’t know what to do. We just wanted to trade to the US so we could both visit family and friends. So we couldn’t decide between another tourist visa or go for the marriage visa. The approved waiver doesn’t apply to a tourist visa from my understanding.   \nWell some Mexican shenanigans happened, and we both don’t want to deal with that anymore. So, we’ve decided to try for the marriage visa. I no longer have a decent paying job that could qualify as supportable, but I could get one once we move back. I would definitely have a place to live as all of my family would let us live with them until we were on our feet again. I still have some the money left from selling everything before I moved.   \nDoes all of this seem feasible? What roadblocks do you foresee? What shouldn’t we forget?  \nThank you.",

I have a question, and all lawyers I've spoken to have given me conflicting answers. \n\n I'm thinking of filing NIW after getting my initial OPT. I've had my case evaluated with wegreened, and they've offered me their refile until approved package. I'm hoping to bump up to EB1 after a few years, and only filing NIW for a priority date. Is it advisable to do this, since 1). I definitely won't be getting a GC through EB2; 2) I'll probably need at least 2-3 yrs to qualify for EB1; 2). In the meantime, I'll need an OPT extension, H1b, etc., want to travel,  and also give consular interviews for visa stamps. And these may be affected after filing an I140. \n\nIs is worth taking this risk for a priority date, especially for a backlogged country ? \n\nSome risk-averse lawyers told me to wait till getting H1B (who knows when the lottery will click). Others told me go for it even before graduating the PhD. What do people think? Please also feel free to point out if there are other threads discussing this... I didn't find any with conclusive answers.\n\nPS: Is it worth going for the refile until approved package with wegreened or should I wait? I know that probably means my case is borderline.",

When they did this they needed to take a birth certificate and only then did they realize they no longer had it. (Unfortunately we suspect it was sent in with their original application for their greencard all the way back in the 80s or its just flat out been lost)\n\nWent to the consulate only to be told there was no b.c under their name or date in that state in Mexico.(side note their sons b.c who was born in the same state also doesn't exist and we suspect both were lost to poor handling) Their husband then in a rush finds and takes a baptism document without noting that the date is wrong(dont get me started on the anger this caused me). This is where the issues all starter. SS office then changes their birth year and says unless they bring in the b.c then they'll have to change all documents to this date now.\n\nFamily member then goes to mexico to find their birth certificate and again they're told it doesn't exist so they have register for a new b.c. They processed to do so. Come back to the US and SS office says no to the new b.C., it has to be the original or a document older than the baptism one for them to accept it. Apparently the new b.c isn't  accepted because \"anyone can say they were born anywhere at anytime and get one\" \n\nNow their renewal is coming up and it's a mess of fear that this will cause a denial.\n\nTheir birth certificate now says the og date but their ss says another and their greencard says the original date.\n\nWe thought about trying to get the og documents back but we're pretty sure that's a pipe dream and they were likely destroyed by now. \n\nWhat's the best course of action here? Should they renew their card and only after try to fix the date? Will they catch this and deny them? \n\nShould we just give up on the og date and fix everything to the date from the baptism document? Meaning get her new b.c changed to the date on the baptism so it matches up with her ss.\n\nI fear trying to fix it now that renewal is up will cause them to deny renewal but I also fear they'll catch that the ss has one date but her documents have another and deny them for \"lying\". \n\nIf their original birth certificate no longer eixist what can we possibly do to fix any of this?\n\n**Edit** To clarify and try to make it easier to understand \n\nSSA changed birth year on their records to 56 when birth year is 57, because original birth certificate is lost and a baptism certificate with the year of 56 was given to them to enroll in Medicare as they needed to do that year.\n\nRenewal for greencard is up. Greencard has the birth year of 57. All documentation has year of 57. Only SSA has 56. \n\nWorry is SSA records having the year 56 will cause issues and denial with greencard renewal as it doesn't match with date on greencard",

        "selftext": "My fiancé was just approved for his K1 Visa in Juárez. Yay! I wanted to post about our experience so that it can give others insight into their process as well.\n\nHere’s our timeline:\n\nApplication mailed: September 27, 2022\nApplication received by U.S.C.I.S: September 30, 2022\n\nNOA 1: October 5, 2022 - Mailed by U.S.C.I.S. California Service Center\n\nNOA 2: September 21, 2023 - Petition sent to NVC in Portsmouth, New Hampshire \n\nNVC email: October 11, 2023 - Confirmation of receipt of approved I-129F petition and forward to Consulate in Ciudad Juárez.\n\nConsulate Ciudad Juárez email: January 16, 2024 - Immigrant Visa Appointment and instructions \n\nMedical Appointment: February 8, 2024\nBiometrics Appointment: February 9, 2024\nDay 1 Document Drop Off: February 12, 2024\nDay 2 Interview: February 13, 2024\n\nQuestions asked during the interview:\n\nWhat is your fiancés name? \nWhere does your fiancé live? \nWhat does your fiancé do for work? \nDo you have children together? \nWhere was your child born? \nIs this your first marriage? Your fiancé’s first marriage?\nIs your fiancé an American citizen by birth or naturalization? \nWhere was your fiancé born? \nWhat will you do when you live in the USA? \nAnd finally ended with, “Welcome the the United States, your visa has been approved.”✅\n\nHere are my tips:\n\n1. Submit as much documents as you can when you initially file for the K1 visa, I mean a stack of documents. Be as heavy handed with the documents as possible send photos, copies of text messages, call logs, social media posts, discussions with family and friends trip re: fiancé, trip itineraries - everything. This will help with processing and the interview (they won’t ask for much documents in the interview). We submitted a huge folder of documents with colored tabs, separators, highlighted parts, cover sheet, all the works. During the interview they only requested both petitioner & beneficiary birth certificates, police certificates (beneficiary), sealed medical packet, form I-134 and 2022 tax return (we printed previous 3 year tax returns, employment letter, bank accounts, proof of residency other evidence but they only took my 2022 tax return).\n\n2. Bring the petitioner’s (U.S. citizen) birth certificate to the interview, a certified copy or the original will suffice. This is important, if you do not have it this will cause a delay in your case.\n\n3. When filling out the form I-134 Declaration of Support, you only need to meet the minimum income requirements - assets are a plus but are not necessary. Income > assets. The government will always prefer an income because it’s consistent and measurable, even if you have 200K in assets that’s still not considered stable unless you have a job. There is a table listed on the U.S.C.I.S. government website that will show you how much money you need to make in order to qualify. IF your income does not meet the required amount THEN you can list your assets to close that gap. There’s a formula they use to calculate the amount of assets you would need to cover  the gap (a quick google search to find it). Also, be careful when listing assets (house, car, property etc.) they will consider how much debt you have and there’s a whole process for assessing value to these assets that also might cause delays if not done properly or they might need additional information. This form in my opinion was the most tedious, confusing form but I found helpful guides on YouTube. \n\n4. Try to arrive to the consulate as early as you can, they do not check appointment times. My fiancé had an appointment at 9 am (for both days) and he was able to enter the consulate at 7am. There are hundreds of people at any given time waiting in line at the consulate, so just take that into consideration. No appointment, no entry. (Sorry petitioners, you shall not pass).\n\n5. The “interview” is spread out in the course of two days, the official appointment date that is listed in the email confirmation from the consulate is just to drop off documents. They will give you a second appointment for the following business day. The second appointment includes the infamous interview which is super quick, 5 minutes more or less.\n\n6. One sleepless night, I scoured the internet looking for any and all tips. I found one that read - the interview is just a formality, the decision has already been made prior to your arrival. (There are many check points, and the application could’ve been rejected before your interview. If rejected at the interview, it’s most likely because the consulate needs missing/more documents). If you see your hard copy file during the interview, try to look if there’s an “approval” stamp on the top page. If you see that, your visa has already been approved. (With the understanding that you’re not missing anything else on the day of the interview). My fiancé heard the same thing from the doctor at his medical appointment, and he saw it on the first day at the consulate for his document drop off. We didn’t put much weight on it, until it was approved.\n\nI wanted to share this for everyone who is going through this process and if you’re reading this, I hope it helps you! Best of luck to all the couples.",

When she was born in Mexico he was not allowed to sign the birth certificate because he was a minor and my mom needed to be present if he did (which idk if true) so basically what I’m \nO asking is. How do we get her\nOver here ASAP. She’s miserable over there and tells us all the time. Do we have to get an immigration lawyer or can we do this process ourselves? Another big reason why he wasn’t able to get her here sooner. Any tip or anybody else has been through this? We are desperate to get her here as soon as possible",

I did, I have my mother’s birth certificate from Mexico and my birth certificate appostile, I made an appointment with the civil office. \n\nAnother hurdle, they said they were not able to process because my mother’s last name Soto Romero is not on my birth certificate only her first name and first last name is. \n\nSo they said they cannot verify she is my mother. \n\nAny guidance would be great!",

Thanks to everyone who already read and responded to my previous post.\r  \n\r  \nI am a German citizen with a US Green Card, and my husband is a German and US citizen. We traveled to Mexico at the end of November 2022, and I gave birth to a daughter there in mid-December. She has Mexican citizenship with a birth certificate and passport.\r  \n\r  \nOriginally, we only planned to stay in Mexico until April/May. In early 2023, we tried to obtain a CRBA. Unfortunately, my husband could only prove 4.5 years of physical presence instead of the required 5 years, so it was unsuccessful.\r  \n\r  \nThen we tried to at least get a visa for her. We only got an appointment at the consulate in December 2024, and expediting the appointment was not possible. I asked for help here on Reddit, and I was pointed to 'Child born abroad to LPR' and according to the CBP website we met all requirements.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, we had some problems, and our return was delayed to mid-November – it was not planned, but I still thought we could enter with our baby since we still met all the requirements! Unfortunately, we were denied entry. We tried again the next day, and it still didn't work, despite presenting the information on paper and arguing that we meet all requirements!!\r  \n\r  \nThey argued that we had lived abroad for the last 11 months. We said it was not planned and it was still a temporary stay, and the website also states 'temporary stay abroad under 1 year'... I could also prove in writing that I am still employed in California. The officers were not interested at all. Both times we were treated very rudely and could only speak to someone through the fence.\r  \n\r  \nSince I had to enter due to my Green Card (funnily I had no issues at all entering the country by myself...) and job, my husband is now staying with our daughter in Mexico, and we are considering our options. Is there any way to appeal this decision? Do we even have a chance?\r  \n\r  \nOtherwise, we can now apply for the I-130. Does anyone know how long that currently takes? \n\nAlso, I can likely apply for US citizenship in April, and then theoretically, we could apply for CRBA again, this time without physical presence, right?\n\nAny other advice? I really miss my baby...\r  \n\r  \nThanks in advance for the help!",

        "selftext": "I'm a natural-born American citizen who has lived mostly in America except for when I occasionally go to visit my long-term girlfriend overseas. I'm a surgeon, so I can't travel much other than the occasional holidays. My girlfriend gave birth abroad. But both of them are overseas. I can't go overseas because of work. \n\nI know that American citizens can't be issued visas. But I'd like for my girlfriend and daughter to come. My girlfriend got offered a job in her company on L1. So I was wondering if my daughter is not yet a US citizen, thereby making her eligible for a L2 visa or ESTA (she has an ESTA eligible passport).\n\nHere are my reasons to believe my daughter is not a US citizen:\n\n* She is not legitimated. In the country she was born, I can't be added onto the birth certificate unless I marry my girlfriend, which I can't do because my girlfriend and I don't want to get married.\n\n* I haven't acknowledged my daughter under oath. I've just acknowledged her, but not under any formal legal oath.  Just when I send money, I'll say in the description box when I need to send money because of daughter's XYZ. \n\n* I haven't agreed in writing to support her until 18, although of course I have every intention of doing so.\n\nSo then she is not a citizen and thus eligible for the L2 visa. Would the Embassy still issue the visa because she isn't technically a citizen yet? I suppose we'd have to disclose I am the father. But she isn't technically a citizen. If the Embassy wouldn't issue her a visa, can she use ESTA? On ESTA would my girlfriend as the custodial parent have to say that my daughter is an American citizen?\n\nEDIT: The main reason besides the lack of marriage I can't be added is if I were to be added somehow, then my daughter would have to take my last name, but we want both of our last names to be given to our daughter.",

        "selftext": "Apparently these births should be handled quite differently than births where the child is born as a citizen of the same country. How do birth certificates or birth registration work in such cases? I normally hear the hospital reports to the government agency which in term the immigration department and puts the child under the same visa restrictions as the parents. But what happens when its time for parents to return. Ie end of assignment, lease and visa?\n\nWhile the child is technically automatically a citizen of parent's country in most cases many times countries need to authenticate birth and parents marriage certificates from the nearest counsulate or embassy where it was issued to prove legitimacy in order to grant a passport which can be rather difficult process for some people. What would happen if the kid returns home and parents never were able to complete the process. The parents may be married at remote state or country. Ie if kid born on the road in Mexico than the parents who are US citizens or one of the a US citizen just drives to the US border and say that is their child? If the child makes it over would they still need to go through the process or that kid despite being technically a US citizen under US nationality laws by descent may still be treated as an undocumented person?\n\nEdit: Mexico is a Jus Soli country and the kid would be registered as a Mexico national by birth at a Mexican hospital but many countries i.e homogenius east asian countries are not that way. \n\nEdit: many in US wants to amend the 14th amendment so that birthright citizenship is restricted to at least legal residents. Though what would be the unintended consequences should US, Canada or the rest of the Americas follow much of the world(aside from Aus, New Zealand) in this. UK and ireland could be an example as they “recently” ended unconditional jus soli. Ie we would have many undocumented kid born in the US causing quite an issue.",

        "selftext": "I've got a tricky (and potentially interesting) case. Doing my best to keep identities private while including enough details...\n\nMy 34 yo significant other (SO) is a German citizen, who came to US (California) to study on a 6mo education visa in Jan 2020. OS arrived just as COVID started and was afraid to travel after 6 month visa expired. SO applied for a visa extension for June 2020, but didn't hear back in time, so ended up staying, afraid they would not be able to return to US if they returned to Germany, bc of Covid. OS got a job (under the table) in order to finish a two year long educational program, then found a place to live and ended up staying until April 2023, continuing to work to afford education in Ayuvredic healing.\n\nSO hadn't seen their family since pre-covid so very much wanted to visit Germany in April 2023. A friend of SO (also German)  suggested a way to do this, which the friend had already tried-- exit via the Mexican border, get a phony visa stamp, then return to USA.\n\nSO felt they had no other choice bc of overstaying initial visa, so followed this suggestion. Unfortunately it didn't work out :(\n\nSO had requested an official visa extension in June 2020, but never got a response from US govt. So, upon deciding to leave in April 2023, SO felt that they needed a visa stamp dated after June 2020, when extension was applied for.\n\nSO arranged a meeting with a provider of false visa stamps at Mexican border and met them in April 2023 at the Mexican border. and received a \"document\" rather than a passport stamp, suggesting SO had exited US via Mexico in August 2020.\n\nSO made it back to Germany, but when they came back to California a month later, after visiting their family, SO was stopped at US airport border because their documents said that they crossed over the USA-Mexico border in August 2020 when the border was closed at that time b/c of COVID. (Unclear why phony visa stamp provider wasn't aware of this or didn't choose a different date :(When detained upon re-entry to CA, SO was interrogated, said they were coming back to US to \"wrap up affairs and return to Germany\".\n\nUnder pressure, SO admitted to details of visa fraud. SO also fraudulently represented bank account info, said they had $15k instead of $2k for purposes of re-entering US, using a photoshopped image of bank account. OS says they did this in a panicked state.Unfortunately all of this is recorded on deportation documents :(\n\nFor some reason , SO was given a five year ban instead of 10 year ban, as would be standard for 3+ years of overstaying visa.\n\nAfter research and reaching out, a US immigration lawyer has recommended not to take any actions before the 5 year ban is over because SO should actually be banned for 10 years for overstaying visa for over 12 months.\n\nFrom my perspective, as a very fortunate US citizen, 5 years is a very a long time, 10 years is a very very long time. And from what I've read there is a strong possibility that SO might never be able to get a US visa again, even after ban is lifted. that is a very very cery long time that will mean my family never get to meet my SO with our child.\n\nSO is a wonderful person, who got spooked by COVID craziness and made some bad choices under pressure. SO is the love of my life, so I am moving to Germany to marry them, and we plan to have children in the next year or two.\n\nIt would very sad if my elderly parents would not be able to meet our future child, or if the only way they could meet our children is for me to return solo to US with my children but without my SO. I and my SO are both hard-working people, trained as healers, organic farmers, and artists.\n\nI would be SO happy to find a way to bring my SO and our future children back to the US to reunite with my family and friends, sooner than the 5 year (or 10 year or lifetime) ban. The idea of a life-long ban is crushing, as SO is a healer and force for good in the world. They feel much more at home in US than Germany and want to contribute to life and healing here in the US. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\\[edited for typos\\]",

The format of the names are:\n\n[Village name] [Father's name] [First name] \n\nTo complicate things further, people use initials for the Village Name and the Father's name. So on my birth certificate my name is written literally as \"Q.R. Peter\" (example). When I was young they started instituting mandatory expansion of the initials. So my name became Queens Richard Peter. But this was the name in my \"Given name\" field in the passport. So my B1/B2 visa had FNU because no surname.\n\nThen when I renewed my passport, I got my name fixed so that the \"Surname\" was \"Queens\" and the \"Given name\" is Richard Peter. The passport office in my country is pretty understanding of these situations and they didn't mind putting the Village Name as the surname. But, I am not Richard. I am Peter. \n\n1. Can I file for a court application for a name change even though I'm not a US citizen or LPR? Can I fix it so that my first name is my first name and my dad's name is my middle name?\n\n2. Can I submit this name change for SEVIS? Or SEVIS only goes by what is there on my passport. In which case, I would need passport renewal. Does this mean I need a new I-20?",

My Aunt, grandmaw, mom, two cousins and I rode a bus there and back. The only activity I remember from that trip was seeing glass-blowing.  \n\nWhat has really caught my interest recently was our immigration experience. We were given wristbands and when returning to the US, a man checked for our wristbands, and asked my cousin a non-threatening question or two (we were three little brown girls who could look Latin American if you use a little imagination sitting with a bunch of white women).\n\nAm I remembering this correctly? Did we really enter Mexico and return to the US with a wristband? I did not have a passport at the time and I don’t remember getting off the bus to show any documents but I was young and could have easily forgotten.",

Fast forward to 2019 when I was 17 and just graduated high school, I decided to come back to Mexico City to do things the correct way before I was a \"legal adult\". I am studying at the university of Arkansas campus queretaro in Mexico and have not seen my family or friends in 4 years now.\nMy visa appointment interview is tomorrow, and I obviously only want to visit my family and friends again even if it was for one week, and l've got the money. I am trying not to get too anxious but I know there is still a pretty high probability of being denied because I still have my illegal parents and sister over there. Background info: at one point I did receive a SSN, temporary license, all pre k- high school, high level soccer, awards, etc. I don't know how to explain to the immigration officers that I truly don't want to stay in the USA because I am absolutely in love with Mexico City and wouldn't move back to NC even given the chance... I just wanna see my people again. So any and all suggestions questions or answers are appreciated🙏🏼",

My Son and I need to go back to the United States mid September. \n\nWe have started the process of getting his passports already: My appointment at the US consulate for his CRBA *(Consular Report of Birth Abroad)* is not until September 5th- I have read that after the appointment I can apply for his US passport which may take 8-12 weeks to receive. I have also requested for my child’s Birth Certificate at the Registro Civil and will need to go through the process of getting his Mexican passport as well but saw that that may take 8 weeks too. \n\nMy question is:\n\nIf I do not receive either passport before mid September will I still be able to travel to the US as long as I present his Mexican certificate of birth (the form I received at the hospital) or his Mexican Birth Certificate? Since I am his mother and am a U.S. citizen? Will they allow us to enter?\n\nHad any one else been through the process of getting a CRBA and child’s passport  in CDMX? How long did it take? Do you have any tips for our appointment so we make sure everything goes smoothly? \n\nIf you did not have either passports, were you able to travel back to the states with your newborn without any passport/ CRBA as long as you can prove you are the parent? We will be entering by land from CDMX to Tijuana via the Cross Border Express and crossing to California. \n\nI also read online that if he has his Mexican passport he can go to the US as long as I present my US Passport. Is this true? If so I am hoping that he gets the Mexican passport soon.\n\nI was able to find this info on help.cbp.gov : \n\n*Children- Travel Documents for infants\nEach American citizen must possess his or her own passport. U.S. and Canadian citizen infants are not required to have a passport for travel by land or sea - although they are required to present a copy of a birth certificate and, if not traveling with both parents, the Department of State suggest a consent letter accompany the other parent(s) due to the rise in instances of child abduction in custody cases, and a growing number of children who are the victims of trafficking.\n\nWhen U.S. citizen children under the age of 16 arrive by land or sea from Canada or Mexico they may present an original or copy of their birth certificate, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or a Naturalization Certificate. \n\nIf traveling domestically, a passport is not needed but If you are driving into the United States (U.S.) and have not yet received a birth certificate for a U.S. or Canadian citizen infant, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer will accept: the birth record issued by the hospital, a letter on hospital letterhead or a letter from the doctor who delivered the child providing details of the birth, including the name of the child, time and place of birth, and the parent(s) named*\n\nFrom what I understand it says to present a copy of birth certificate, but how soon will I receive his American birth certificate after his CRBA appointment? Or is his Mexican one okay? Or Will I receive a form after my CRBA appointment on Sept 5th that will allow him to travel with me? \n\nAll of this is a lot to navigate with a newborn so any help is much appreciated. Thank you for reading and for any advice",

I am currently on H1 visa, my wife (a dependent on my visa until she is lucky enough to be picked in the lottery) is also employed. We make good money and are successful in our careers. I have a sibling who is a Swedish citizen, who also has no way (from what we understood) to have our single, dependent parent to live with him for a longer time with a resident permit or equivalent. \n\nI have no hopes of a GC given my country of birth. Even if I had a GC, there’s no way to bring my dependent parent to US ever. She has a tourist visa but I am sure visiting here for 6 months every year, she will be denied entry at some point, even if she doesn’t actually abuse the visa (and doesn’t take any illegal employment). I am just annoyed by this system and I am ready to leave US. \n\nSo I am looking for recommendations on which countries are best suited. I am also open to explore a golden/investment visa, depending on the cost In my next home, I want two freedoms - \n1. Mainly I want to be in a country that supports bringing your dependent parent in, without them having to travel every 6 months or go through some stupid immigration check that looks down on her. \n\n2. I don’t want to be tied/limited to one employer and be able to pursue contract/business/startup income opportunities. Not a deal breaker but nice to have. \n\nTLDR: which countries (that are deemed good places to live of course) will allow a high skilled worker to bring a dependent parent with a permit to reside with them. \n\nThank you for your advise",

Their father is a U.S. citizen, and we were never married. I have cared of them since I gave birth to them, and he has never gave responsibility for them. Now, I'd like to file citizenship for them to allow them to start studying in the U.S. The problem comes when of course, I need their father's complete attention and consent on the process of naturalization. I can't get in direct contact with him because his couple doesn't allow him to talk to me (which obviously is not an acceptable reason) so I can't continue with the process because I need information and consent from him. Of course, we can deduct that this lady is aware of the possibility of me requesting child support. So, I'd really appreciate your advise 🙏Should I sue for child support? Remember I am still Mexican as well as my twins. Or should I continue trying to file the naturalization process by myself? Or is there another suggestion?

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just had a question or maybe a few questions about getting denied a tourist Mexican visa. \n\nRecently, a family member and her daughter who is 13 in Mexico recently she had her interview. Unfortunately it was denied.\n\nThe letter states that she can reapply, but she needs stronger ties, involving: professional work, school, family, or social links. She mentioned she has a food stand and she has family in the states. Given what is in the letter it wasn’t enough and I am wondering what is something she can do to strengthen her ties. \n\nI feel like it’s pretty obvious that some type of work or school would help. But I’m just not sure, how she could integrate herself in those fields. She didn’t receive a proper education which I feel limits most of those areas. I’m trying to brainstorm, but all that comes to mind are possible solutions but almost immediately my brain suggests why such idea wouldn’t be enough. \n\nShe doesn’t have any plans to work in the country. It is for a genuine tourist visa . From what I’ve heard a lot of people have abused this process to eventually stay in the country. \n\nI was thinking that maybe she’d like to come to my graduation next year in June or she’d love to see her family who she hasn’t seen in years but, I feel those aren’t solutions to our problem. \n\nAny suggestions would be a major help as we’d like to implement some type of solution as soon as possible and give proof that she is trying. I was wondering if anybody here has experienced something similar or what their family member, friend, or just someone you know. And what they did to become successful during the interview.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, so this was an extremely sad week this week for my wife and I. My wife has lived in the United States now for 28 years. She came into the US with her mom when she was 16 and her mom never took take of her papers, only her own. My wife and I married in 2017 and decided to get this out of the way beginning in 2018. It was June 2022 we were documentarily completed, petition and waiver of unlawful entry all approved. We received the interview appointment in March 2023 and began preparing for everything. All documents, evidence, everything was nicely organized and a nice handheld organizer and labeled to be a professional as possible. We ever got her police report even though it was technically not required. There was nothing that was not ready for the interview day. Here we are on Thursday 5/25 and my wife emerges from the consulate about to burst into tears. She was refused and handed a blue sheet of paper and told we would receive and email for a DS-5535.\r  \n\r  \nUpon review of what the DS-5535 even was and the email specifically stating to email the responses to the seven questions to the email provided. She was given her passport back and sent on her way. We later find out that the DS-5535 is taking months and months if not over a year to hear anything back. This is where it got really bad. My wife has lived in Dallas for 28 years and and we have a life together in Dallas. My wife owns two house she pays taxes on and we live in my home where she has her minor child and my mentally disabled son she helps to care for. She has nothing in Mexico. She has no family, no house, no nothing, and she was dealt with this ridiculous request that has no end date in sight.\r  \n\r  \nOur attorney says to email congress and senator and he'll also submit an inquiry. I just cannot comprehend how these interviewers can get on these ridiculous power trips that are seriously unjustified. The whole purpose of the DS-5535 is extreme vetting for national security risks. My wife is a petite 4'10\" little mexican lady who has only ever been in Mexico and the US. All of her previous documents were approved and she even had extra approvals with the unlawful entry waiver. How can one human being not see the situation what what it is rather than getting on a power trip can throwing the only thing you can at her, a DS-5535. I think because of Trump and and others alike they are hatters for the immigrants and making unjust decisions. They have no business approving people for Visas. This process should not be a one way process only where the interviewer is the only one who knows why. Just like in the US, you are allegedly innocent until proven guilty. The facts must be presented from BOTH sides, not just one. In this case is is entirely unfair because the interview holds the cards and has no accountability to the affected person and provide some justification for asking for more information. My wife was unfairly judged and ultimately for something she had no control over when her mom brought her into the United States. My wife simply made the best of her life. My was was NEVER on government provided services like food stamps, medicaid, nothing like that. She worked and stood on her own two feet.\r  \n\r  \nAs a legally born US Citizen, rest assured I will not stop and there will be some accountability to this system. It is abused by interviewers and I absolutely will NOT stand around and just let the system work itself out. I am a hardworking US Citizen who met a lovely lady who is now my wife and we are both paying the price for this unjustified interviewers decisions. Get ready for some hell raising!",

We should have more documents in the U.S. that we can submit later. \n\nWe then applied for a B2 Visa for her to be able to bring her to the U.S. and we got the earliest available interview appointment in November 2024. Unfortunately, our request for an expedited appointment was denied. I'm currently checking the website several times every day for an earlier appointment in case someone else cancels the appointment. That's what the consulate told us. So far without success...\n\nWe both have to return to work in May in California and right now we have no idea how to bring our baby girl with us to the U.S.!\n\nI already called the consulate, the U.S. citizen emergency contact number, Border Protection and Department of State without success.

We decided to apply for a change of status while I stay in the US since is the fastest method to get the TN visa status (\\~3 weeks according to the USCIS website) vs going to a US consulate in Mexico (the earliest visa appointment available at any given consulate is in mid-August). \n\nAs I understand it the change of status doesn't provide me with a visa stamp which is a requirement if I want to travel outside the US. \n\nOnce I get the change of status to TN, can I apply for the visa stamp at the consulate while my TN status is still valid?\n\nThe reason for this is that my EAD expires mid-May, so I cannot wait for the consulate appointment until August.",

        "selftext": "In over two decades of life, I have hardly lived in my home country of India (only around 4 years) and this was not even during the foundational or advanced years of my pre-adult life but my formative years (basically 2nd-5th grade). \n\nBefore living in India, I lived in the Mediterranean immersed in Judeo-Christian and Islamic lifestyle. My parents left India days after my birth. So, my foundational years were spent in a mix of an Indian and English speaking household with parents of two religions and having friends of nearly three to four religions and a multitude of languages. This is the first count against my Indian identity in that I am extremely heterogeneously mixed in both language and culture. \n\nWhen living in India, I found it very hard to bond to the culture. I went to a private international school that had a mix of foreign and domestic students and primarily conducted education in English. I regularly failed my domestic language classes, having a greater affinity for the foreign languages. The most I could enjoy was the food. My parents saw this and we left for United States where I started 6th grade. This is the second count against my Indian identity in that I seemed to have an intrinsic otherness to it.\n\nI went through the entire middle school, high school, and college life in United States. I didn't care much of my immigration, thinking I was going to be fine being a potluck of so many cultures and experiences. This is the third count against my Indian identity in that even the Western biases (I call it this as a way to distinguish cultural, ethical, and metatheoretic inducing that the culture has that's distinct from the Indian equivalent) of education were highly internalized to my psyche. It wasn't until I was taken off my dependency status from my parents and faced the dehumanization of my entire identity to just another working immigrant that my psyche started to appear as a discarded persona, forcing me to adopt another co-psyche.\n\nI've been involved in many churches, mosques, and hillels. Its a recent occurrence that I am fraternizing with the graduate student body which is significantly immigrant that I am getting any sort of first degree connection (most has been second degree through books and philosophical treatments of Indian subcontinent religious development) to my culture. Even then, its more rocky than I'd want it to be and not as easy to make as with American relationships. This strengthens the second count even further.\n\nA lot of these feelings are taking over me and its giving me a hard time to work towards my own cause because I'm at a point where I feel neither America nor India would take me. I don't even have the SSN equivalent documents for India which is given to every American here (I think) when they are born. Now that I'm cracking into my professional life in America, I feel like I have to behave like an immigrant now even though I have the mannerisms and upbringing of a domestic person. I have to tell employers my status and they infer what they do of the average immigrant. \n\nMy question is are these feelings unfounded? Do I actually have to assume my true spirit and force myself to learn a culture my parents don't even want me to go back to? They speak about H1B, etc. What is the ethic surrounding this geopolitical quandary? Am I actually still bound to my home country even if I don't internally feel any identity to it? Why do I need to keep lying to immigrant officers that I have intent to return to the country to contribute to it? I don't believe it is natural at all for a human to take on so many identities. \n\nI am open to philosophical or legal discussions. Please ask for any further clarifications.",

        "selftext": "I'll start this post with some of the facts of our case. My wife and I were married in the US on August 10, 2020. She is from Mexico and returned there after our wedding. I started our immigration paperwork in October 2020 through USCIS. We received approval of the I-130 on 09/24/21 and the case was sent to the NVC. Our case was approved by the NVC and marked documentarily complete on 01/03/2022. We have been waiting for an interview date in Ciudad Juarez since then.\n\nMy question is whether there is any information available that will help us estimate when her interview date might be scheduled. The NVC releases monthly backlog reports that show how many DC cases were assigned interview dates each month but I'm not sure how helpful those are as they don't specify the numbers by embassy. I've called to the NVC and the embassy in Juarez, sent emails to both, and have gotten nowhere. I've also contacted one of my Senators for assistance and not gotten much help there, either.\n\nAccording to the backlog reports, when we were first given the DC notice in January 2022, there were 465k IV applicants who were documentarily approved and waiting for interviews. However, it's my understanding (I could very well be wrong, though) that IR-1 visas have priority over certain other IV categories, with the exception of certain asylum cases, so I'm not sure whether we actually would have started in the back of the line or not. If there is a priority given, it certainly doesn't feel like it. lol. \n\nI realize I'm not going to get any definitive date or anything. I also realize that Ciudad Juarez is one of the busiest embassies in the world and the current situation at the border may very well be causing some delay as well. However, I'm hoping there are some resources available that might help us understand what cases are currently under review or something. The hardest part about this whole process has been the not knowing. My wife and I have both said that even if the interview was another year away, we would feel better just knowing that there's a date to look forward to. So, any resource that can help us calculate a somewhat-accurate estimate of where the embassy is currently at would help lift our spirits.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated...\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "I am in a rather complicated situation. 22 years ago I committed a monumental stupidity. I use the word monumental as a qualifier because it truly opened my eyes to the wrong choices I made two decades ago. Rewinding my life to the year 2000, I committed a crime that redefined my life in a negative way. Regret... yes, very much but it's too late for that and I am unable to time-travel back to correct those foolish and irresponsible actions, the consequences of which I am now confronted with. The crime was counterfeiting currency. I reproduced or \"cloned\" 60 pieces of 50 Euro banknotes (bills, if you're an American reading this) and spent them with a whatever-they'll-never-find-out-it-was-me attitude. Little did I know (and this is why I aptly began this story with the phrase \"monumental stupidity\" above) that police in my country have some of the most sophisticated tools for solving crimes, even those perpetrated by perfectionist offenders. I underestimated them.\n\nAfter spending the entire lot of my own version of 50 Euros, I got my first inkling of dark clouds ahead when a family member called me to say that police were making inquiries about my whereabouts. I can still vividly remember having that conversation on that iconic Nokia 3310, dazed and asking myself how I was so quickly and positively identified as the source of these fake Euros, how to deal with the prospect of a prison sentence and the effect this criminal record will have on my future, how to explain this to those who I least wanted to disappoint in my life and endless other hows, whys and whats.\n\nBeing a coward, I decided to not deal with the consequences. I left Europe and arrived somewhere in Asia (I won't say where for my privacy and because of how this story further unravels). I will redact the irrelevant bits, like what happened in the many years that followed. I basically created and lived a new life for myself. The first few years were lonely and rather quiet. I knew back then that criminals were almost always caught when they made that fatal mistake of contacting their families and friends back home and revealing their whereabouts or asking for money to be transferred which creates a traceable transaction or paper trail. Eventually friendships and relationships were established during my 22 years abroad. Some of them evolved to very close friendships and led to fateful decisions which I will briefly write about now.\n\nIn 2003 I mentioned my predicament to a friend of mine (a local of the country I am in now) and told him the entire story. He was and is still very understanding and after listening to my (mis)adventure he thought it only existed in movies but he promised to help find a solution. I was both grateful and also surprised because I never asked for help in the first place. It didn't take long for him to suggest one. Within a few weeks he invited me for dinner at his parents' home. After dinner, he mentioned that his brother knew someone who worked at the local birth registry office. Curious, I listened intently. He then mentioned that a friend of a friend would be willing, for 2k USD, to have his birth certificate used for applying for a passport under his name but with my picture on it. This friend of a friend was disabled, around my age, never traveled and had no intention of ever traveling internationally in the future. After what seemed to be an eternity of silence, I noticed he was looking at me and waiting for me to say something. I quickly switched to analyst mode, weighing the pros, cons and risks in my mind. I asked how this could be achieved when I couldn't speak the language fluently yet and if this could endanger the passport application process, he quickly dismissed this concern with a wave and said a travel agent will take care of everything. He raised his beer bottle and said cheers.\n\nI got the passport and have since that year (2003) moved on with my life. I established a company, opened bank accounts, built an impeccable credit history, bought a house and led a life without any infractions and trouble with local laws (apart of course from this closely guarded secret of having a borrowed identity). When I left my home country, I needed just 3 semesters to complete an undergraduate degree. Anxious to have academic credentials for a more solid standing in society, I studied part time locally and graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in business.\n\nFast forward to last year. I was having a cup of coffee one morning and reading the local headlines on my iPad. COVID this, COVID that. Travel bans and countries locked down. Now here's an article about vaccines and there's one about so many COVID deaths in Italy. Then boom... I see it. An article about the government introducing a new e-passport, completely redesigned and incorporating a new system  linked to Interpol's databases. Ironically, it's funded by the EU with most of the logistics handled by, you guessed it, the country I'm originally from. Next to the article was a video of masked government officials proudly showing off the new passport system and how it scanned law enforcement databases and international AFIS systems in real time. One immigration officer talks about the advantages of the new passport and how the biometric identifiers stored in the passport's chip are now checked against international police databases.     \n\nAfter reading this, I discussed this new development with my friend. At first, he dismissed it but I pressed on and told him not to ignore the level of sophistication of this new e-passport technology. After a few weeks of serious thoughts, I decided it was time to expect a day of reckoning and that the earlier I prepared the less unpleasant the outcome.\n\nSo I come to the final part of this story. I intend to settle my affairs in this country. I will close my bank accounts, sell my land and house (I already have an offer) and return this borrowed identity to the rightful owner. After 22 years on the run, I plan to fly back to Europe and surrender to my country's authorities. In the meantime, I applied for a passport at the embassy because the one I had when I left Europe expired 19 years ago. The embassy made inquiries back home (they always do when a passport is applied for) and told me there is \"something\" on the system preventing a full passport from being issued. As a result, I am eligible for an ETD only. ETD stands for emergency travel document and it is valid for travel to my country only. It doesn't allow travel to other countries.  Great. This means I'm still wanted.\n\nNow this is the dilemma I am in now and it's the reason for posting this story here on reddit :\n\nI have to (must!) leave this country with the local passport. This is because the ETD from my country has no record of entry and therefore no record of me ever entering here under my real name. Using it at the airport to fly to Europe might lead to me being detained, a thought I am not fond of when I think about local prison conditions here. I therefore plan to fly from here (country X) to an assumed destination (in this case, Mexico). I use the word assumed because I have no intention of completing all legs of the journey. The local passport allows visa-free travel to Mexico and no transit visa is required for my country in Europe. I will therefore fly directly from this country to my country's airport like this:\n\nMy current country --> ZRH (my country's main international airport which allows transits without visa)\n\nand not board the second leg to Mexico. \n\nAt the airport, I will present my ETD to immigration and I expect to be detained for the offence I committed 22 years ago.\n\nMy question is if this is something that can be done realistically, given how I am not familiar with how airport transit arrangements work. Will I be liable to pay or reimburse the airline for \"skipping\" the second and return legs of this booking? Will the flight to Mexico just leave without me or will one less passenger on the manifest trigger a large-scale hunt for me at the airport. LOL I'm most worried about this because of the media attention it might generate.\n\nThank you for reading this rather long and convoluted story.",

        "selftext": "I was airlifted to the U.S. from Haiti with my (adoptive) brother because of the earthquake in 2010.  My US-born adoptive parents had already started the adoption process. The U.S. airlifted over 1000 children, and those who were in our category were handed over to custody of adoptive parents.\n\nThe adoption was incomplete in Haiti. The U.S. adopted this law at the end of 2010 that states that the adoptees could just their status from \"humanitarian parole\" to \"green card\" - deadline of 3 years.https://www.uscis.gov/archive/green-card-through-the-help-haiti-act-of-2010.\n\nI came with my brother and was admitted on humanitarian parole.  Our parents finalized our adoption in Illinois in 2010 at the court (there are photos) and we were given Illinois \"record of foreign birth\" with our adoptive parents' names and dates of births.  https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/birth-death-other-records/adoption.html\n\nMy parents did NOT adjust my status or my brother's status before 2013.  When we finished high school, we realized that we did not have proper documentation to get SSN (or so we thought).  We hired a lawyer to apply for EADs and GCs.  My brother and I received our green cards at the ages of 22 and 21 respectively. We have not yet had them for 5 years.\n\nMy brother and I now want to travel abroad, so we went to get passports recently.  I thought he went to the Haitian consulate, so I was confused when he came home with a U.S. passport.  It turns out he went to the passport agency NOT the Haitian consulate and got a U.S. passport.  Took 6 months.  https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/x6i0do/my_brother_got_a_us_passport_as_pr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nI wanted to get a Haitian passport to travel to Thailand (it’s supposed to be here in 3 weeks) but now I am confused if my brother and I are entitled to U.S. passports.  I called USCIS yesterday twice. The first officer said that yes, I was a US citizen, the second officer said no, yes, and then eventually admitted she does not know and safe someone from USCIS would call me.\n\nIf I go to the passport agency with my green card and a filled out DS11 form with my brother, and if I get a U.S. passport (both officers told me I should apply), am I in any danger of misrepresenting myself as a U.S. citizen. I don't know whether I am, and I don't know if the lawyer we hired gave us bad advice.\n\nFINALLY, here is some reading on some government and law association articles on the Haitian orphans who were airlifted in 2010.https://www.aila.org/File/DownloadEmbeddedFile/53055\n\nI believe I am category 2 (paroled into US not no actual adoption or grant of legal custody in Haiti).   Link to law of December 2010 outlining how Haitian orphans get status adjusted.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ293/pdf/PLAW-111publ293.pdf\n\nMy question is - if i get a US passport, am I safe to use it if I present all the information (green card, Illinois record of foreign birth, my parents' US birth certificates)? Also could I be a us citizen and just had not known?",

        "selftext": "I am posting a question here for my friend, A\n\nHis Grandmother (gma) is insane and decided that she \"wanted her daughter to be born in Mexico\" so despite living in America under a workers permit, she traveled to Mexico to give birth only to immediately bring the baby (Y) back to the US. Gma obtained a green card shortly after but never got her daughter (Y) a green card despite never knowing a life outside of America. 36 years later Y hasn't been able to afford to naturalize, and in 2020 lost her vision due to health issues leading to increasing financial struggles and risk of homelessness. I want to know what options she may have because this was a situation caused by her mom that she's never been able to resolve.\n\nAt this time gma is still a green card holder. all 4 of Y's children are legal US citizens. her children are 22 (A), 19, 15, and 12 no one has enough money to support the family yet so we need to get her at least legal enough to obtain social assistance of some kind so she doesn't end up homeless since she is unable to work due to her disability.\n\nEdit: we aren't sure if Y's mother (Gma) brought her legally or not but we assume so as Gma later obtained her greencard, but we think she assumed that her baby was covered automatically. Because of this assumption she never got any paperwork for her child, ultimately screwing Y over. Y now doesn't have any proof of how she entered the country and doesn't have any citizenship even though her mom is a LPR and her sisters and children are citizens and Y has lived in America her entire life up to this point.",
