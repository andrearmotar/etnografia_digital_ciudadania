        "selftext": "I was brought to the U.S. as a child and have been a lawful permanent resident since 1993. My father became a U.S. citizen before I turned 18, and I was living with him at the time. Based on what I’ve read about **derivative citizenship under INA §320**, I should already be a U.S. citizen.\n\nI went to the post office recently to apply for a U.S. passport, but they told me I needed a **Certificate of Citizenship (N-600)** or naturalization certificate to prove my citizenship. I explained that I derived citizenship through my dad when I was a minor, but they said they couldn't process my application without official proof from USCIS. She looked at me and was like you were supposed to do this back then. Not now. I figured the post office would not be helpful in this matter. I then called the passport agency but they are telling me I need to provide an itinerary that I am going somewhere internationally before I get an appointment and also made mention of me needing my parents wedding certificate which I cant get. They were married in Mexico back in 83. \n\nI have the following 1. Dads naturalization certificate 2. 4 notarized affidavits that I was living with him one being from him. 3. my expired resident alien card at that time 4. my birth certificate 5. current state ID 6. The passport application itself. \n\n\n\n* Should I just go ahead and file Form **N-600** with USCIS?\n* Has anyone else successfully gotten a passport approved **without** the N-600 (maybe through affidavits or with the right documents)?\n* Is it worth hiring a lawyer for this, or can I handle it myself if I have the documents?\n\nAny insight or shared experiences would be really appreciated. I just want to get this resolved the right way.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏🏼",

        "selftext": "TL;DR My father immigrated to the US, obtained a green card and then my mom came over with me in the early '90s. Both parents eventually got naturalized and because I was under 18 when that happened, I derived citizenship. My parents were told the expensive N600 wasn't necessary to file since it was just a proof document. They got me a passport instead, which I've renewed since then.\n\nFast forward to today, I'm learning that the government requires a Certificate of Citizenship for certain security clearances and doesn't accept a US Passport as proof for foreign born US citizens, so I'm preparing to file the N-600. **Where do I get my port-of-entry and A-number info?**\n\nThe form asks for the entry date and the document number for my entry. My mom vaguely remembers my name and picture was on her foreign passport and the visa doc, which was allowed back then instead of needing a separate passport for your toddler. But the entry documentation is long gone. I also do not know my A-number or if I even had one. Did minors under 6 get green cards in the late '90s? If I had one, it was turned in once I was given my US passport and my parents don't have a photocopy. \n\nI don't want to request my entire A-file because I'm reading it can take over 6 months. Can someone tell me which files or documents I should request for entry details and whether that should be under my name, or will I have to do the same pull on my mom? Should I be requesting this info from CBP instead? Will my A-number be on anything I request from USCIS? I'm hoping all of this won't matter since I'll be including my US passport info but I don't want to skip anything and get RFE'd.\n\nThe other concern I have is both my parents' Naturalization Certs list them as divorced and my original birth certificate is missing. I found a photocopy of my foreign BC and the original translation that was stamped/certified. The translation clearly has both my parents' names on it, and I have a copy of their divorce decree. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to name me directly in it. Should I collect grade school transcripts to submit as proof of physical custody?",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI went for my passport appointment  at the embassy, but my application was outright rejected without proper review. They told me I’m not eligible to apply directly and that my father must first file an immigrant petition (I-130) and get me a green card since I was born before he became a U.S. citizen.\n\nI wasn’t even given a chance to submit any evidence—they just dismissed my application immediately. From what I understand, some people in similar situations have been able to apply directly. Was the embassy correct in rejecting me outright, or should they have processed my case differently?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights from anyone who has gone through something similar!\n\nEDIT: I'm sorry I didn't include the details in this post earlier. So my father naturalized after my birth and I visited U.S. on an I-551 visa before I turned 18 and lived there for some time under the legal and physical custody of my dad. For some reasons my dad dragged the passport application and now that I'm an adult I applied for one myself but I'm so heartbroken that without even reviewing evidence they outright rejected my application. \n\nThank you,",

I went through my GC application in Europe through my parent who's an American citizen. I was less than 21 years old when all this started, so I was placed in that category.  \nNow, advance the story to this January—I had submitted my N-400 (citizenship), and I had done a bit of research and observed that my birth certificate and status of entry into civil life have an error. It has provided my date of birth as 30/05, whereas in reality it would be 30/04. Now, my passport, GC, and driving license all have the correct date (30/04), so that's okay—only the birth certificate and civil entry status.  \nI’ve reached out to several lawyers for advice, and I’ve gotten mixed responses. Some say, “It’s no big deal, it’s just a clerical error—carry on!” while others are warning that it could be an issue because USCIS typically follows the birth certificate and advising me to withdraw my N-400.  \nThis is the catch—I know that when my parent had applied for me, they have applied on the correct date (30/04). Given the current state in Syria, it cannot be changed from, and I have no one who can help me there.  \nHas anyone ever experienced the same issue? Some people have had it reversed, having the incorrect passport but the correct birth certificate. Do I just go ahead and follow through with my application, or do I withdraw it so I don't give myself a headache later on? Any advice from people who've gone through the same would be much appreciated!  \nThanks in advance for all help.",

It's a long letter detailing why all the secondary evidence I submitted is not good enough to prove my mother resided in the U.S. for a cumulative of 5 years prior to my birth in 1999. And it says I have 30 days to submit either more evidence or a rebuttal.\n\nThe matter is, I have exhausted all possible evidence, so that is not an option. It took me a year to put together the evidence that I did submit, working with a private investigator, estranged relatives, and doing my own research. I was told by two lawyers that the evidence I submitted was pretty good. but even if I spent another year looking for evidence, I would not find a thing... so, I have to write a rebuttal.\n\nMy question here is about this rebuttal--does anyone have any advice for this? Would this rebuttal letter have to be in legalese, or written for emotional appeal? Do I tell them that it was extremely difficult to produce the evidence I did submit, given that it was from 1981-1986? Do I tell them how desperate I am to be able to build a future in the U.S., where I've lived for 15 years? I'm at an utter loss here so my suggestions might be ignorant. ANY advice will be sincerely appreciated. I have 30 days...\n\nThank you. Happy new year to all.",

        "selftext": "So I lurked on this sub to find out everything I could about the appointment for my wife to finally naturalize. I found so many informative posts I wanted to leave one for someone else, so here goes.\n\nWe applied for her citizenship this September. At first, the waiting time was 6 months so we expected no movement until next year. All of a sudden, a bunch of things started happening, and suddenly we're in November and she has an appointment 30 days later. We received notification that her appointment was set for today, 12/20 and boy, were we happy. Unfortunately, we had a cruise that we were going on and it arrived in the port of LA the morning of the 20th (I know, insane). But her appointment was 12:30pm so we decided to risk it and went anyway (it was awesome, and there was a moment when she said to me, \"Hey, I think this might be the last time I ever use my green card!\").\n\nLuckily no delays so we had plenty of time to get off our cruise, get some breakfast, do some last minute cramming, and then head over the LA Field Office near Little Tokyo. For those who are not familiar, the LA FO (field office) has no public parking, so you either gotta get lucky on the street or find a parking lot nearby, and the two largest ones were under construction so they were closed. We ended up parking in the lot directly across from the field office at the Los Angeles mall (but there are a TON of homeless and the place reeks). The parking itself is fine, $17 max. And given how long we were stuck at the Field Office, we just ended up paying the max, lol.\n\nWe crossed the street and there are two entrances, one with a red barrier - we went there first and the guard told us we needed to go around the corner to the black barrier.\n\nWe got the barrier and they asked to see our appointment letter, then asked us if we had any bombs, explosives, weapons, drugs, etc (just like at the airport). We went through security and then got directed to the 8th floor.\n\nFrom there, we went to suite 8024, where we checked in before when we got her permanent green card. No picture this time, they just checked our letter, then told us to go out to suite 8054.\n\nAbout 10 people in total were waiting, one couple was practicing the 100 questions so we sat in the back away from them. We got there at 11:50 for her 12:30pm appointment and nobody told us how long the wait would be. We were just told to sit and wait for our names to be called, but nobody's name got called for a good hour. There are NO vending machines in that building, so if you get there early, bring water and a snack. The second floor has a cafeteria, if you really want something. We brought our own water.\n\nFinally, around 1:30pm, her name gets called and she asks if I can go in with her. Guy is super nice, asks to see her appointment letter, and lets me go with her. I heard stories about a mean Latino lady, so I figure we were in the clear. I dunno if she's mean or just nitpicky, either way, we didn't bump into her. Our guy was named John and he was so friendly and kind.\n\nHe did let me know that I was there as a courtesy, so I couldn't answer questions and I needed to be silent. He started out with a little small talk, like how was the wait, etc. Then we got into it.\n\nFirst he asked her about her name, birthdate, etc (information to confirm she is who she says she is). We brought her appointment letter, her green card, and her current passport (my wife is Taiwanese so she has a Taiwanese passport). We also brought my birth certificate (citizen by birth), our marriage license, and my passport. He did ask for her driver's license as well, so don't forget US government-issued ID, if you don't have a driver's license.\n\nThen he asked her to read a sentence, which was just one of the 100 questions: How many US Senators do we have? And then he had her write a sentence, which was the answer: \"We have one hundred senators\" but she had to write out the numbers, not just use 100.\n\nThen we did the test, which was 6 questions and she thankfully nailed them all. I sadly don't remember because I was worried she would give goofy answers like she did when we were practicing (If the President and the Vice President cannot be president, who becomes the President? - ME! no, the Speaker of the House, stop saying that)\n\nWe moved onto the N400 and he asked some of the required questions like \"Have you ever been arrested for a crime, have you ever been part of the military or police\" etc. He didn't ask them all - I know this because we also went over the N400 just in case, so she wouldn't get tripped up by some of the weird wording. He then asked about her time outside of the US and she had the dates memorized, but he only asked if she spent 6 months or more outside the US.\n\nIn the end, she nailed everything, and when he asked if she was willing to become a US citizen, take up arms if necessary, serve in a noncombat role if necessary, etc, she answered correctly, and we were done! Holy shit, I felt so relieved, he had our file in front of him and it was at least 2 inches thick full of documents. Since she never committed any crimes, he said it does make it easier, also we had a ton of evidence so he wasn't concerned about our application and no red flags.\n\nThe only snag was she wanted to change her name (she doesn't have an English name so everyone mispronounces her name and she's fed up with 5 years of it lol, so she wanted an English name, her birth name, last time) but he said she wouldn't get to take the oath until at least March, maybe later. With the new administration coming in Jan 20th, we decided to just change her name later (despite how much of a hassle that will be!) and get her citizenship now.\n\nAn hour later, we had her certificate in hand! The guy who administered the oath said that Social Security now changes status automatically but he can't be sure (there is a question on the N400 that asks if you want them to do it for you). Other than that, same experience as others, but I was a little thrown by the oath timeline if you wanted a name change (could be because it's the end of the year, who knows).\n\nWe have to go to SSA on Monday and then apply for her passport, we couldn't today because it was late and we were tired. Hope this helps - edit, tried to post this last night but it didn't go through so I went to bed. Realized I needed a flair, so I added one, but I'm not going to go back and change everything from \"Today\" to \"yesterday\"",

        "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI'd like some clarification on a requirement listed on this [gov page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html). I'm 22, born and residing in the UK,  claiming US citizenship & applying for my first US passport with my US citizen father. I was born in wedlock and my father has spent 30+ years in the US before my birth. \n\nWe're pretty much ready to head to the embassy. We've obtained proof of his presence in the US (college transcripts, IRS records), my identifications (my UK birth cert, current and expired UK passport), his identifications (US birth cert, US passport), marriage and marriage dissolution records, my passport photo, and some forms. \n\nAlthough, I'm unsure of one thing. The page I linked mentions: \n\n>*\"A child must also meet other requirements including:*\n\n>*i) At least one parent has a* [*genetic or gestational connection*](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/US-Citizenship-DNA-Testing.html) *to the child*\n\n>*ii) Both parents in the marriage show a parental relationship with the child: Examples of this relationship include: medical, tax, educational, or other documents that show the individual has acted in a parental role\"*\n\nNowhere on this [UK US embassy page](https://uk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/citizenship/claiming-u-s-citizenship-and-applying-for-your-first-u-s-passport-aged-18-or-over/) about claiming citizenship mentions obtaining evidence of point ii. It does cover point i:\n\n>*\"3) Evidence of parentage*\n\n>*Credible and substantial evidence of the blood relationship between yourself and your U.S. parent(s) is required in the form of a birth certificate.\"*\n\nI haven't obtained any evidence to show that both my parents have had a parental role with me. I would be able to get strong & conclusive evidence to that effect from before I turned 18, but it'd take a bit of time to obtain it, so I want to know if it's necessary. My thinking is that the first linked page is referring to children, and the second page is specific to over 18s. So, perhaps point ii isn't relevant to us given my age?\n\n",

        "selftext": "(Before I begin, I kindly ask that I not be DM'd for consultations. I am happy to provide firm or probono recommendations via DM, but nothing more). \n\nHi all, \n\nUsing a throwaway. I have been lurking here for a while without commenting anything, but I feel like I need to give my two cents given the amount of posts on this sub. Excuse any typos or grammatical errors. I am typing this while I am highly caffeinated and dealing with my own caseload. \n\nFellow immigration attorneys, please correct me if I'm wrong on any points. If you're not a legal professional, I do not want to hear it. \n\nFinally, none of this is legal advice. Please always consult with an attorney before making any decisions on your specific case. \n\n\n**1. Will DACA be taken away?**\n\nRemember, nothing can be guaranteed. Genuinely, no one knows what will happen. \n\nI will say that in my opinion, likely no-- the economy makes way too much money from DACA folks. I do believe that they will dangle it like a carrot to appease right-wing voters. Major corporations employ DACAmented folks. The SSN from work permits have allowed more tax revenue to come in. Too much is at stake. Legally, the legal arguments at the courts surrounding DACA involve constitutional rights, which themselves aren't going anywhere anytime soon. It's honestly just a topic that is often talked about, but hardly understood by many. \n\n**2. What about I-131F PIP?**\n\nAs of today (11/7), this has been revoked. \n\n**3. Will the mass deportations actually happen? Is it actually feasible?**\n\nI want to put this into perspective. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. Currently, DHS has about 92,000 officers, and ICE has about 21,000 officers. It is asinine to try to achieve this. \n\nLet's say it actually does begin and people are getting rounded up. Guess what? Not all undocumented folks are just undocumented-- many have TPS, pending asylum applications, pending T/U Visas, and work permits (see my point regarding #1). Unless a migrant has an expedited removal (not likely), DHS/ICE still needs to process each deportee, assign them A#s, and follow basic procedures. If they don't? That's a very easy way to reverse a deportation order. It's the equivalent of convicting someone of murder using a confession made under a very obvious 4/5th amendment violation. Slam dunk case. \n\nOh, and you know who has to handle all of these deportation cases? Federal DHS attorneys. They're already overworked, and they tend to exercise discretion. If no discretion, the overworked ones tend to gloss over cases and provide weak arguments. Only major attention is paid to serious crimes. You'd be surprised the amount of times DHS attorneys have gotten my clients' names wrong or made procedurally embarrassing typos. \n\n**4. What about ICE roundups?**\n\nThey still happen. Still need to follow procedures. If not, lawsuits and lots of deportation reversals. \n\n**5. Will there be a plan to denaturalize? Is it actually feasible? What about birthright citizenship?**\n\nSee #1 and #3. \n\n**6. What is likely to happen coming January?**\n\nIMO, the end of prosecutorial discretion in deportation proceedings will likely happen immediately. This means that DHS attorneys will have to prosecute all cases. However, see my point for #3. \n\n**7. What will happen to my pending USCIS case? What will USCIS do now?**\n\nVaries. USCIS is highly understaffed right now, and the backlogs are ridiculous. My guess is that between now and December, there will be a push to try to get as many I-485/N400s adjudicated before January. This may result in fees increasing for future applications. \n\n**8. Should I try to file my [insert case here] with the USCIS?**\n\nI cannot answer this. I highly recommend an attorney. Unless your case involves a complex immigration history (think border apprehensions, previous deportations, court hearings or USCIS interviews), probono organizations may be able to take your case. \n\n**9. Can greencards be taken away?**\n\nGreencard refers to lawful permanent resident status (aka \"LPR\"). LPR status is given under a plethora amount of reasons-- each have their own statutory and common law requirements. Yes, theonewhoshallnotbenamed definitely enacted policies that made obtaining these harder, but not impossible. Again though, to take an LPR status, the USCIS is required to issue a Notice of Intent to Rescind, and it would allow you to argue your case. \n\nAgain, USCIS is backlogged. When backlogs continue, immigration attorneys threaten mandamus lawsuits. Who has to handle these? US Attorneys. Guess what they will try to do? Try to dismiss as quickly and easily as possible, bringing the process back to square one. What do lawyers hate (among many things)? Their success ratings going down. \n\n**10. I legit think that they're gonna throw the whole rulebook away and just try to remove DACA, deport people, and do whatever erratically.**\n\nThen we'll cross that bridge if we get to it. IMO, I never underestimated THAT ONE and his team. They are strategic and play the irrational and ludicrous card very well. Do I think they actually want to achieve the above? Definitely. However, I don't think it will come from the White House necessarily. They'll try to slowly change the social and political atmosphere, beginning at home. \n\nThis means that the revolution starts at home. It starts in how we educate ourselves and each other. It starts by breaking generational curses and preventing history from repeating itself. It means raising our children better. It means being in community. \n\n**11. I want to leave the US.**\n\nI can't blame you. I cannot give any information on this, and this is beyond the scope of this subreddit. \n\n**12. So, what now?**\n\nAs naive as it is for me to say, I think good always wins. The right is banking on your apathy, despair, and helplessness. \n\n**13. I'm glad that this is all happening. We need stricter immigration laws.**\n\nWhy are you in this sub? Let me know when you've joined the Olympics though, because the amount of mental gymnastics you are doing to justify your ignorance should be enough to give you a gold medal. \n\n\nEDIT: WOW. Lots of questions. I promise to try to get to as many as I can. I am but a mere attorney trying to meet his billable hours and trying to comfort my immigrant parents at the same time. \n\n\nEDIT #2: I'm adding some extra points that might help cover the general theme of questions I've been getting: \n\n\n\n**A. What about Operation Wetback?**\n\nCrackdowns and ICE sweeps are still happening. Furthermore, they gotta be processed still. This means that they need to be in detention centers while ICE gets the proper paperwork from the deportee's home country (or Mexico), set up transportation, and deport them. Yes, this includes if it's even in a sweep and go type of crackdown. \n\nI don't underestimate the vile nature of THAT ONE and what he wants to do, but I mention the facts as someone who is heavily involved in this legal work. \n\n\n**B. What will change with my [enter type of application]? Do you think orangeblob will change it?**\n\nNo law has changed. This includes statutory and common law. Your case will move forward as is unless told otherwise. \n\nIn terms of likelihood-- again, look at #1 and #3. They can dangle the hateful rhetoric as a carrot to right-wingers all they want, but money talks the most.\n\n\n**C. Will family petitions change? Employment?**\n\nThey didn't during 2017-2021. They very likely will not change here. Major corporations, especially tech ones, rely on employment-based petitions heavily. \n\n\n**D. Everyone said don't worry and things got worse years ago. I'm scared.**\n\nThis is exactly what they want you to feel. This is their goal. This is why I made my post. Let this fear and grief transmute into courage and motivation for a better world for all of us. Overall, it's not attorneys or people in fancy suits that make the most change. It's the community leaders, the librarians, the students, the homeless shelter managers, and the barbers that know the names of everyone on the block. Hope is not lost. \n\n**E. I came here the “right way,” so everyone should follow the law/it’s only “illegals” that have to worry/any other unoriginal variation**\n\nDM me for resources on how to have better empathy. \n\n\n**EDIT #3 (FINAL EDIT).**\n\nFew more frequently asked questions: \n\n**F. Why do you think there will be a push to adjudicate AOS/N400? Isn't USCIS understaffed?** \n\nIt happened post election in 2016. Pragmatically, it was probably because USCIS was expecting a large influx of applications come 2017. They decided to increase the fees, but they needed to give proper notice and time for people to file AOS/N400. Thus, leading to a mass influx of applications. \n\nAs for adjudication: N400s are the last hurdle for most folks, and they're generally not as difficult to adjudicate as other applications. It's another application officers can remove from their plate. Immediate relative based AOS or AOS based on current priority dates (without inadmissibility issues) are also generally easy to adjudicate. Yes, they are understaffed, but sometimes USCIS can shift focus briefly to some applications.\n\nWill all of this happen come 2025? That's the hope. My naive side wants to believe that USCIS wants to make as many people residents and citizens as quickly as possible. There were a numerous amount of natz approvals in my firm right before the election. My guess is that they wanted people to vote.\n\nNow, do I think CONSULAR ones will also get pushed? No clue. That didn’t happen 2017-2021. See Item G below. \n\n**G. What about I-130s with priority dates? What will happen now?**\n\nThis type of question is complex for several reasons. (1) I-130s are provided for all sorts of reasons, both family and employment based, (2) It depends on the type, the country, and the field office handling this case and (3) It also depends if consular processing will need to get involved. \n\nRight now, nothing has changed. This means that the priority dates on the visa bulletins are ones to look at. \n\nWhat a lot of immigration attorneys do is if there's a valid reason to expedite (most common being a family medical emergency back home), then they request it. If that doesn't work, a threat of a lawsuit sometimes helps. If not, then we file a mandamus. The key to doing all of this is for when the I-130 has been pending for longer than the processing times. Keep in mind that US Attorneys are not a fan of mandamus because they are contractually required to take these cases, so they try to dismiss as quickly as possible. This usually leads to the government agency making their decision on the case.  \n\nNow, if consular processing is involved: Each consular office operates on their own timeline and their own procedures. They hardly post these procedures. Guatemala takes about 6 months, and Peru takes about 2 years. Some attorneys also threaten to involve the courts for delays here, but consulates are controlled by the Department of State, making this a bit more challenging. \n\nNow, the burning question: will the above change? Pragmatically, overrunning and delaying the above is a poor financial decision, and money talks. You don't wanna mess with the golden nuggets of massive corporations. Can it happen though? Yes. Orangeblob did make the process slower for folks, and yes RFEs were issued annoyingly often. However, there is always room for argument and litigation, so not all hope is lost. \n\nWhat about priority dates? Will they change? Priority dates vary on visa type, availability, and country of origin. There could be delays, yes. No certainty just yet. \n\n**H. What about [insert student or business related visa]?** \n\nI unfortunately do not have experience in this field of immigration law. I cannot give a proper educated answer. \n\n**I. What about asylum? Title 42?**\n\nToo soon to tell. Asylum interviews are in a massive backlog at the moment. In 2018, when DV/gang based claims were slashed, many asylum offices tried to help by \"stalling\" their decisions. It put people in limbo, but there was at least no referrals to court or initiation of removal proceedings. Will that happen here? Maybe, but again, too soon to tell. \n\n**J. If ICE starts rounding people up, am I next? Can I get picked up? What if I have an upcoming court hearing? Will they deport me?**\n\nThere is generally a priority system for ICE. They tend to be: those with pending removal orders (especially if removal order was based on criminal conviction) or those convicted of deportable crimes. \n\nIf you have a criminal conviction, do not freak out. Not all convictions are deportable ones. This is a specific legal definition that is too complicated for me to type out. If you were charged after 2010, you must be provided with full legal advice of any immigration consequences of a potential conviction. \n\nHaving an upcoming court hearing (even via a CBP One appt) doesn't necessarily make you a priority. Some of those hearings may be for pending asylum cases and there are no crim issues. \n\nEven if you have a previous deportation order, there are still options and there are still ways to fight a deportation. \n\nIf you're still scared about being on a priority, think of this: A cop is doing speed checks on a 65mph speed limit freeway. There are a lot of cars on the freeway. Who is he likely to go after? Someone going 67, 75, or 90? Someone with a pending removal order (especially due to a serious criminal conviction) is much higher up there. Remember, if you fall under this category, there are options and there are ways to protect you. \n\n**K. But what if [insert scary scenario]? These are all just legal protections, and he wants to get rid of all of this. He's a fascist.** \n\nRemember, they are banking on your anxiety and uncertainty. The need for certainty and comfort during turbulent times is human nature. What is also human nature is innovation, the quest for justice, and community. Even if the worst comes to light, you have so many folks who are on your side and ready to fight for you (not just attorneys). \n\nHere is another metaphor I like to use: In the show Supernatural, Lucifer knew that Sam was going to give consent to take over his body. He had the whole timeline planned, down to the smallest detail. You know what he underestimated? Sam's love for his brother, Dean. Sure, Lucifer could predict human behavior, but he could never outsmart it. I say this here as well: don't underestimate the love that people have for one another. (also, the first five seasons in Supernatural were the superior ones, and I will immediately block anyone who tells me otherwise).\n\n**L. I messaged you requesting recommendations for nonprofit orgs and firms. When can I hear back?**\n\nI will do what I can. I will most likely answer these questions over the weekend. Any specific legal questions, unless something urgently stands out to me, I will likely not be able to answer.  \n\n\n",

My mom has to renew her license but this year is different due to Real ID which is a requirement by 2025. \n\nIn order to renew she has to show her naturalization form. Somewhere down the line she lost it or it got stolen (still not sure on this). We have to retrieve it but theres another issue on her license it says she was born 1958 but on her birth certificate from Mexico it says 1959. My mom swears the 58 one is accurate but I'm not so sure at this point (and my grandma recently passed so we can't ask her). \n\nWe need to get her naturalization form but my dad is afraid to because he thinks they might turn this around on us and say she isn't who she says she is even though she has a license, social security, and various other proofs of who she is just not the naturalization or a passport. Moreover, he's afraid they might revoke her Medicare benefits.\n\nIs this a legitimate concern?\n\nAlso if we go through the process what are the chances of getting the form? \n\nFrom my standpoint, I'm thinking she's just a record in a database and without numbers lining up to that record they aren't going to give it to her but I don't know.\n\nOther information: my Grandpa was born in the United States and was a US citizen. He never got my mom her citizenship because my mom said he was a go with the flow kind of guy and this was just work he didn't want to do. My mom got naturalized at age 14 (she believes) since my grandpa wouldn't do it. We have the birth certificate of my Grandpa and his obituary that cites my mom. Do you think this would help? \n\nShould I continue with filling out the N-565 form or should we just get a lawyer?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance! ",

The child was born via IVF from donor sperm.\n\nAccording to several things I read, the child acquired US citizenship at birth.  For example, [this](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12-part-h-chapter-2) states:\n\n> To be considered a child of a U.S. citizen father, the child must be: ...  The child of a U.S. citizen father who is married to the child’s genetic or gestational parent at the time of the child’s birth (even if no genetic or gestational relationship exists with the U.S. citizen father) if both parents are recognized by the relevant jurisdiction as the child’s legal parents ...\n\nBut all the instructions for all the forms I have seen (e.g. N-600, CRBA, etc.) seem to require that the father be the biological father of the child.\n\n1) What is up with this?\n\n2) Assuming we can get past this, it seems a CRBA (if possible) would be much cheaper and quicker than a N-600.  We live in Texas but could easily travel to Mexico.  Is that allowed for the CRBA?\n\nTIA",

        "selftext": "Location: SLC, UT\n\nLooking for weigh ins/opinions on our case. I’ll try to make this short and can expand if needed in comments. \n\n- My husband naturalized as a USC in 2021. \n\n- His youngest daughter was 16 so had the opportunity to receive derivative citizenship. \n\n- She lived outside the US and we petitioned for her visa/green card. In her visa interview and packet, we presented, unsolicited, a notarized letter from her mother releasing her to her father. \n\n- She entered the country two weeks before her 18th birthday, in 2023. This should’ve qualified her for citizenship.\n\n- We applied for her passport after she got here. They wanted additional documentation. We provided it. They came back asking for more, including the full divorce proceedings of her parents. Sent the 70-page hearing that I previously did not know existed. Apparently all parties “agreed” to make up a story about my husband and he never showed up to the hearing because he wasn’t informed.\n\n- Full custody was granted to the mother over given the story they claimed.\n\n- Mexico does have laws surrounding potestad paternal, and we did have a lawyer and notary in Mexico draft a document showing both the state law where the custody hearing was filed as well as the federal laws, which, in spite of the ruling, do give the mother release to allow the children to be with their father. We submitted this with the full hearing, hoping it would give credence to her letter she provided to release her daughter into her father’s custody to get her visa. \n(BY THE WAY—how on earth did they approve the visa with that letter if they don’t find it valid for citizenship?! They approved him to take her out of the country for the visa!)\n\n- We finally received rejection on the passport, saying he had no paternal rights (which is indicated in the decree) but can dispute it. I wanted to exhaust all options, and I think we are pretty much there.\n\nQUESTION: Are there any ideas if there is a way to make this successful, or do we just wait out her time on a green card before she gets to apply for citizenship? If so, what would you recommend?\nI’m trying to get an appt with USCIS to discuss. The website says I can make it online, then it says to call, but calling, if it’s not for biometrics or one other item, it doesn’t allow me to make an appointment. \n\nIf we paid $$$$ for a citizenship certificate for her (silly), would it be granted? Or would they send us through these same hoops? I don’t know if they want all these burdens of proof. \nIf I knew about all this in the start, I wouldn’t have pushed to get her petition going in any hurry before she was 18. \n\nShe’s now 19.5.",

        "selftext": "Good Afternoon, r/USCIS,\n\nBasically, the title summarizes it pretty well. I am 22 years old, having been born and raised in Germany to an American father and German mother. I am fairly certain I did not automatically obtain citizenship at birth due to my dad not meeting the residency requirements (5 years in total LIVING in the US, with two of the years being completed after the 14th birthday). He never filed a CRBA, or form N600K. Still, he is a US citizen, having and having kept ONLY the US Citizenship (despite living in Germany for close to 50 years). \n\nMy Grandfather, however, would very much be meeting the requirements (He lived in the USA for about 40 years before my Dad was born, and about 5 years just after), and as stated in the Instructions for form N600K, this would also count, given I can prove my Dads dependency on my Grandpa (which I also can). The problem here is that I am now over 18 years of age, which means form N600K doesn't apply to me anymore. Another important factor would be that my grandpa was in the Air Force for a pretty long time, with this also being the reason for him moving to Germany 5 years after adopting my Dad. We have multiple files documenting his service and exceptional performance during these years, on North American AND \"foreign\" US soil (\"Foreign\" as in the barracks here in Germany). \n\nI am currently residing in Germany, but I'm very much planning on moving to the US sooner than later. I believe I do have everything it should take to be granted citizenship / prove I am eligible for citizenship, my only REAL issue is the fact that theres no Form to fill out as I am, as stated before, resident in Germany, over the Age of 18 and have never lived in the USA myself. \n\nMy question now is the following: What are my options? How, where, and to whom can I prove my eligibility for citizenship based on the factors I just listed? Are there any forms I can fill out (except for N-600, N-600K, and DS-2029, as I don't meet the eligibility requirements for these)? Are there any resources for cases as mine? Sadly, the two USCIS agents I talked to weren't of much help, which is why I am asking here. If you made it this far, I appreciate you taking time to read through this, and if you have any answers/tips/ideas where to start, I'd greatly appreciate you telling me either through the comments or PMs. If you need any more information to be able to help me, please let me know as well.\n\nThank you very much and have a great rest of your day,\n\nJake\n\n",

        "selftext": "Reddit has helped me immensely and I hope by sharing my naturalization experience to become US citizen will be helpful to someone one day.\n\nI already had an application for removing the condition on my green card which was already over 2 years in with no movement. I got i751  stating I can continue residing for another 48 months until my green card came in. I figured since I have been eligible to apply for naturalization for over a year now to go for it. I was hesitant only because my origin country doesn’t allow dual citizenship. But given my family is American, I figured it’s time. \n\nSo I sent my online naturalization application in January 2024. I pretty much already had everything from my green card application so I added more pictures and my second child’s birth certificate as additional proof to show my marriage is legit. Probably the easiest of all applications (F1, H1B, green card). Since they already had my biometric from green card application, I was shortly sent a letter stating I won’t have to do it again. \n\nI believe in June, I got a letter stating I was scheduled for interview in Centennial, CO office at 8.15am in July. I like a fool assumed 8.15am means time I need to be building. By the time I made it to second floor for the interview, my name was already called out before. But the person interviewing was kind and told me not to stress about being late. \n\nHe was wonderful from start to end. I had a very simple test on my understanding of English language followed by civic test. All questions were from the guide they have on USCIS website (100 questions). I did get one wrong, but made up with follow up question. As soon as I got 6 right, not more questions were asked. Rest of the interview was more of a conversation. Though I had a minor police record (no charges), he said it’s not a big deal himself. He made it clear I did a thorough job on documents I provided and it answered any questions he had. \n\nThe only thing I didn’t print in entirety was my lease agreement. Since we did move between green card and citizenship application, that’s the only document he asked for. He just asked me to email it to him. I took his permission to use my phone and sent him the file during the interview itself. \n\nDuring the interview, he told me that he will approve my application and next step is review by his supervisor. He said I will receive a letter indicating the review step shortly. I did clarify if his supervisor might ask more documents or re interview to which he responded it’s unlikely since all applications are reviewed by him and supervisor together before the interview I was in. \n\nI interpreted that shortly will mean a week but it took 3 weeks I think to get that letter. Within another 2 weeks, I got a letter saying my case was approved and I will get another letter for oath of allegiance. I got letter that my oath of allegiance date has been scheduled in first week of Aug. The actual oath date was within 3 weeks from date letter was received.\n\nOn the oath day, we accidentally went to 2nd floor  after security. Oath was on third floor. 5 mins befor the oath, security perosn asked the room if anyone is here for the oath and off we went to correct floor. Now this room made lot more sense. There were lot of people there like 150ish. There were some 40+ new citizens. Straightforward and whole thing wrapped up in an hour and person hosting was kind to allow people to take pictures/vidoes at each step. \n\nThe whole thing was a dream and end to end took probably 6 months. \n\n(Minor but worth mentioning: the entry security guy is horrible. He speaks fast and sort of strange. It was very hard to understand what he was saying: Basically to put shoes directly on the X-ray roller instead of bins. Given it is USCIS office where people come whose English is not a first language, he seemed very standoffish. So was his buddy. All other officers on other floors were nice is it was just these two. The guy actually made a child cry since his parents had to ask him a few times to repeat what he said. Which he did loud and FAST again. If not for him, I would say this Centennial office is amazing)",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any guidance able to be offered here as I know this is a fairly complex issue...\n\n  \nI was originally born in India, but have been a lawful permanent resident via Green Card living in the US for the past 30 years when my parents immigrated here. I am trying to determine what my best course of action is to be issued a US Passport, as I was originally planning to file an N-400 for Naturalization, and just now discovered that believe I may already be a US Citizen under INA 320 and the Child Citizenship Act, but am not entirely sure. My parents are now divorced, but while still married, my father became a US Citizen through Naturalization in 2003 (well before I turned 18), my mother did not file at that time and is still currently a Green Card holder. I believe at this point I also acquired Citizenship as his child who was a LPR residing in the US, which if true, I believe would make me eligible to file an N-600 as proof of citizenship and in turn obtain my US Passport.\n\n  \nThe main issue is that I do not have much official documentation due to losing my documents over the years, so am not sure what I can/can't file for. I do not currently have a physical copy of my green card, which expired within the last year, though I do have my USCIS Alien Number presumably allowing for my file/status to be looked up and verified. I don't have a valid driver's license or other ID as this expired, and requires my green card (which I do not physically have) to renew. I also do not have my birth certificate, or a copy, as this was lost. I am not in active communication with my father, though I could likely reach out to obtain his proof of citizenship if absolutely needed.\n\n  \nI am trying to determine what my best course of action is to ultimately be issued a US Passport, and again greatly appreciate any guidance anyone can offer. Some specific questions I have are:\n\n* Am I indeed already a US Citizen through INA 320 / the Child Citizenship Act?\n* If so, what documents will I need for N-600 and can I still file this given I do not have a copy of my birth certificate? Can this someone how be discerned from my USCIS Alien Number and associated Green Card file?\n* Am I able to / should I submit a FOIA to obtain my original Green Card application and associated birth certificate from USCIS? Would this help me to file any of the other methods?\n* Can I apply directly for a US Passport or would I still need my N-600 first given the lack of documentation? Do I need a copy of my birth certificate for this?\n* Will I need to obtain proof of my Father's Citizenship from him, or is there some other way for USCIS to verify this?\n* Is my Green Card currently being expired a blocker for any of this, and would I need to first file to replace/renew this?\n* Given my lack of birth certificate, would it be easier for me to file N-400 as I'm still a LPR via Green Card? Would I still be eligible to do this, or would I be denied and routed to N-600?\n\n  \nMy main goal is simply to obtain a US Passport to be able to travel, as I have never actually held a passport of India or any other country. During my first and only trip from India to the US, I travelled on my parents passport. I'd like to understand what the easiest and eligible path would be for me given the documentation/evidence I have, ideally taking into consideration the quickest processing times.",

After 3-4 years I decided to marry her. Before we met, she had already given birth to my step daughter who was about 1 year old when we started dating. My step daughter is a legal US citizen as she was born here. On her birth certificate it only identifies her mother and that she has no biological father listed. \n\nMy wife and I were worried if it was possible for my step daughter to petition her biological father to America even though he has no legal relationship with her, neither in his own country nor the US. She and her family have told me stories about how she was in an abusive relationship with him and took the opportunity to leave. We were afraid he might try to come in contact with our daughter in the future and convince her to sponsor him.",

We are at a crossroads currently, we need to make a choice of me going completely alone to the USA to give birth to guarantee citizenship or staying abroad with family, to later try to prove physical presence.\n\nI have some documents of me being raised there for the first three years of my life (mostly photos) and some pediatrician records plus vaccines. My parents were able to find some bills, obviously on their names as I was a baby.  \n  \nLater in my life, around my 20's, I lived in the USA for 3 years and some months but the only thing consistent in my name is my car registry (imported the car from Mexico which had always been on my name and continued to be on my name until I sold it in the USA, insurance payments, plus CarFax records). I lived with my parents, so all the bills are on their names.   \n  \nI have some W-2's, but I was never able to find full-time job, so it's usually on average three days a week payments or 39 hours a week. I do have passport stamps that record me staying in for long periods of time.\n\nI never went to the Doctor although I was assigned a PCP and everything, but I was terrified of going bankrupt in the American system, so I just drove down to Mexico and went for healthcare there when needed. So, no medical records.\n\nSo, in Summary I have:\n\n* Baby photos, medical pediatrician records and some bills on my parent's names (worth 3 years).\n* Bank Statements, with my name and address.\n* Car Registries and Insurance Payments with address.\n* Bills on my parent's names for water, electric and internet bills.\n* W-2's with part-time employment (three years).\n* Pet Records (vaccines, pet tax, etc).\n* Passport Stamps. I have all my passports, even when I was a baby, so this includes those stamps.\n* Four years of Tax Returns in which I paid taxes because I was living there at the time.\n* Realistically, I have around 5, maybe 6 years of proof.\n\n  \nWould that be enough? Are photos actually admissible (especially for toddlerhood?).   \nWhat uncommon documents do the accept? TIA!",

        "selftext": "Edit: I only needed my old US passport. None of the supporting documentation requested on the form was required despite the form stating so. Something I probably should have realised was that you also have to complete the second half of the form stating both parents details even if one is not an American - this wasn’t immediately obvious given that the whole form is structured around parental permission and isn’t intuitive if you are either over the age of 18 or this is not your first passport. Thanks for the advice everyone. \n\nHi all, I’m a US citizen born overseas. My last passport was issued before I was 16 and as a consequence I am applying via DS11 and require an appointment. \n\nDS11 requires me to provide my consular report of birth abroad, my parents proof of us citizenship, my parents marriage certificate, and an affidavit showing all your US citizen parents periods and places of residence and physical presence before your birth (ds-5507).\n\nI’m able to provide all of this except DS-5507 owing to the fact my mother is now quite old - the events would have been 30 years ago and she can’t recall.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience in a similar situation applying without DS-5507? I have three previous passports (expired) and hope that if viewed holistically my application would be accepted - particularly considering DS-5507 is a prerequisite for the consular report of birth abroad when initially filed. \n\nAny advice or experience would be greatly appreciated.

        "selftext": "My fiancé was just approved for his K1 Visa in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Yay! I wanted to post about our experience so that it can give others insight into their process as well.\n\nHere’s our timeline:\n\nApplication mailed: September 27, 2022\n\nApplication received by U.S.C.I.S: September 30, 2022\n\nNOA 1: October 5, 2022 - Mailed by U.S.C.I.S. California Service Center\n\nNOA 2: September 21, 2023 - Petition sent to NVC in Portsmouth, New Hampshire \n\nNVC email: October 11, 2023 - Confirmation of receipt of approved I-129F petition and forward to Consulate in Ciudad Juárez.\n\nConsulate Ciudad Juárez email: January 16, 2024 - Immigrant Visa Appointment and instructions \n\nMedical Appointment: February 8, 2024\nBiometrics Appointment: February 9, 2024\nDay 1 Document Drop Off: February 12, 2024\nDay 2 Interview: February 13, 2024\n\nQuestions asked during the interview:\n\nWhat is your fiancés name? \nWhere does your fiancé live? \nWhat does your fiancé do for work? \nDo you have children together? \nWhere was your child born? \nIs this your first marriage? Your fiancé’s first marriage?\nIs your fiancé an American citizen by birth or naturalization? \nWhere was your fiancé born? \nWhat will you do when you live in the USA? \nAnd finally ended with, “Welcome the the United States, your visa has been approved.”✅\n\nHere are my tips:\n\n1. Submit as much documents as you can when you initially file for the K1 visa, I mean a stack of documents. Be as heavy handed with the documents as possible send photos, copies of text messages, call logs, social media posts, discussions with family and friends trip re: fiancé, trip itineraries - everything. This will help with processing and the interview (they won’t ask for much documents in the interview). We submitted a huge folder of documents with colored tabs, separators, highlighted parts, cover sheet, all the works. During the interview they only requested both petitioner & beneficiary birth certificates, police certificates (beneficiary), sealed medical packet, form I-134 and 2022 tax return (we printed previous 3 year tax returns, employment letter, bank accounts, proof of residency other evidence but they only took my 2022 tax return).\n\n2. Bring the petitioner’s (U.S. citizen) birth certificate to the interview, a certified copy or the original will suffice. This is important, if you do not have it this will cause a delay in your case.\n\n3. When filling out the form I-134 Declaration of Support, you only need to meet the minimum income requirements - assets are a plus but are not necessary. Income > assets. The government will always prefer an income because it’s consistent and measurable, even if you have 200K in assets that’s still not considered stable unless you have a job. There is a table listed on the U.S.C.I.S. government website that will show you how much money you need to make in order to qualify. IF your income does not meet the required amount THEN you can list your assets to close that gap. There’s a formula they use to calculate the amount of assets you would need to cover  the gap (a quick google search to find it). Also, be careful when listing assets (house, car, property etc.) they will consider how much debt you have and there’s a whole process for assessing value to these assets that also might cause delays if not done properly or they might need additional information. This form in my opinion was the most tedious, confusing form but I found helpful guides on YouTube. \n\n4. Try to arrive to the consulate as early as you can, they do not check appointment times. My fiancé had an appointment at 9 am (for both days) and he was able to enter the consulate at 7am. There are hundreds of people at any given time waiting in line at the consulate, so just take that into consideration. No appointment, no entry. (Sorry petitioners, you shall not pass).\n\n5. The “interview” is spread out in the course of two days, the official appointment date that is listed in the email confirmation from the consulate is just to drop off documents. They will give you a second appointment for the following business day. The second appointment includes the infamous interview which is super quick, 5 minutes more or less.\n\n6. One sleepless night, I scoured the internet looking for any and all tips. I found one that read - the interview is just a formality, the decision has already been made prior to your arrival. (There are many check points and the application could’ve been rejected before your interview. If rejected at the interview, it’s most likely because the consulate needs missing/more documents that you didn’t bring). If you see your hard copy file during the interview, try to look if there’s an “approval” stamp on the top page. If you see that, your visa has already been approved. (With the understanding that you’re not missing anything else on the day of the interview). My fiancé heard the same thing from the doctor at his medical appointment, and he saw it on the first day at the consulate for his document drop off. We didn’t put much weight on it, until it was approved.\n\nI wanted to share this for everyone who is going through this process and if you’re reading this, I hope it helps you! Best of luck to all the couples.",

We got our interview notice on November 23, 2023 and the first consular interview was Tuesday Jan. 30, 2024. \n\nI'm writing out the process of the interview just because I've found similar posts helpful as we tried to navigate the process of the consular interview and to give folks a sense of the timeline, where we stayed, and other details in case it's helpful. \n\nWe have a three year old daughter which made the potential journey a little more challenging, but overall it worked out well. \n\nDay 1 (Wednesday, Jan. 24): Flew into El Paso and stayed the night there with my folks who live there, which also helped. \n\nDay 2 (Thursday, Jan. 25): Rented a car from the El Paso airport (got the Mexico insurance, which was more expensive than the actual rental, which for nine days was $408). We then drove into Juarez and on that day went to the office of the Attorney General of the state to get her Carta No Antecedentes Penales. I'd highly suggest to visit the office at Pueblito Mexicano, which is near the Puente Libre (the free international bridge into Juarez). That process only took maybe 40 minutes and that's because we didn't know exactly where to go. The price was $118 pesos, so not very much, but make sure you take Mexican cash because they don't accept American credit cards or dollars. Got the letter right then and there and that was the first step done. Checked into hotel, Maria Bonita near the consulate, which is walking distance from everywhere you need to go, but not the closest, or cheapest. But did include a good warm breakfast everyday plus had an indoor pool, which our toddler loved. \n\nDay 3 (Friday, Jan. 26): Wife had her medical appointment at Clinica Medica Internacional, which was recommended by our lawyers. The clinic offered to pick her up and drop her back off. My wife explained her experience, but overall it lasted about 3 1/2 hours, during which time I visited the nearby mall with our daughter. \n\nDay 4 and Day 5 (Saturday, Jan. 27 and Sunday, Jan. 28): Took our daughter to la Rodadora, a children's interactive space, and can't recommend it enough. Other than that, spent time with family who crossed into Juarez on Sunday and just had days to relax for what was ahead. \n\nDay 6 (Monday, Jan. 29): Wife had her biometrics appointment at the CAS, right near the consulate, and this was the quickest process. She got there before her appointment time at 3:00 p.m. and was out within 5-10 minutes. Process for that day done. \n\nDay 7 (Tuesday, Jan. 30): First consular interview day. Wife went in with all her documents, including original birth certificates for her, me and our daughter, all the other paperwork needed, her passport, and even more than 100 pictures proving our marriage (they never asked for any pictures or our daughter's birth certificate). Process took about 3 hours and at the end gave her the final interview appointment for the next day, Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. \n\nDay 8 (Wednesday, Jan. 31): Final consular interview. Got to the consulate with my wife at 7:00, line was already super long. Don't think anyone checks for anyone's actual scheduled time. But thankfully line moved very quickly. My wife was in the door of the consulate before 7:30. I waited at a nearby Starbucks, then on the bridge near the consulate and she came out at 10:30, smile on face and having just been approved for her green card, got the green piece of paper, and now we only needed to wait for her passport. \n\nDays 9 and 10 (Thursday, Feb. 1, Friday, Feb. 2) - Day 9 we just worked remotely from the hotel, anxious to get the email letting us know that her passport was ready. Didn't get the email that day, but did catch a movie at the mall and dinner nearby. Juarez is going through a bit of a violent rough patch, but felt safe throughout. Then finally on Friday, Feb. 2, as we were eating our latest breakfast at the hotel got the email that her passport was ready at the CAS location near the consulate, where she did her biometrics. Picked it up, worked a little, had lunch, purchased some final things to take home and crossed back into El Paso through the Zaragoza bridge (took about 25 minutes) BUT TAKE EXACT MONEY NEEDED to cross back. We didn't know we had to pay (our mistake) and the car behind us saved our life by giving us the $2.20 needed to cross. Wife had to get out and get a stamp, took about 7-9 minutes, and then met me back in the U.S. where I parked our car.\n\nAnd that was it. Flew back home to central Texas on Saturday after spending the night back with my folks in El Paso and back home now with my wife as an LPR. I'm sure I'm missing details but hope this is helpful to anyone going through the process. Process seems needlessly long and arduous, but in terms of days we expected to be there, it was definitely on the low end. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: Timeline and our (U.S. citizen and DACA spouse) experience with the process from DACA to PIP and AOS.**\n\nHello! My spouse recently received approval for Adjustment of Status (AOS). We started the process in 2022, when we first applied for Parole in Place (PIP) to allow us to apply for AOS. We wanted to share our timeline and answer any questions people may have that are in a similar situation. We received a lot of help from online groups, including this subreddit, and we want to help out in any way we can. We cannot provide legal advice, but we can point you in a direction or share our personal experiences :)\n\n# Timeline\n\n* **Parole in Place (PIP)** \\[\\~11 months\\]\n   * October 2022 - PIP Application (Form I-131) Submitted\n   * November 2022 - Biometrics Appointment\n   * July 2023 - Request for Evidence (RFE) Received and Submitted\n   * August 2023 - PIP Approved (Form I-94 Received)\n* **Adjustment of Status (AOS)** \\[\\~2.5 months\\]\n   * October 2023 - AOS Application Submitted\n   * November 2023 - Biometrics Appointment\n   * December 2023 - AOS Approved\n\n# Parole in Place (PIP)\n\n[USCIS Website on PIP](https://www.uscis.gov/military/discretionary-options-for-military-members-enlistees-and-their-families)\n\n[USCIS Brochure on PIP](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/brochures/Brochure-Immigration_Options_for_Family_of_Certain_Military_Members_and_Veterans.pdf)\n\nAfter our marriage, the only issue keeping us from applying for an adjustment of status was my spouse's lack of legal entry into the U.S. My spouse has maintained residence in the U.S. since receiving DACA about a decade ago. We met with an immigration attorney, and they misinformed us that the only options would be consular processing or applying for Advance Parole (AP). A few online searches later, we stumbled upon Parole in Place and decided to try to apply for it ourselves. I am unsure why this was not mentioned as an option by the attorney, as I am a U.S. citizen and an active-duty service-member, so my spouse qualifies to apply.\n\nWe missed our biometrics appointment since the notice came in the mail after the date for which the appointment was set. We arrived at the local USCIS Application Support Center (ASC) the next day, anyways, to ask if anything could be done. They graciously saw us that day, but we are unsure if this is a standard practice.\n\nWhen we received our Form I-94, a passport-style photo was glued onto the top left corner of the card, covering the \"Departure Record\" and \"Admission Number\" areas. We didn't even know these were behind the photo, and we were confused when filling out the AOS forms that required the \"Admission Number.\" A hair dryer helped soften up the glue and we were able to remove the photo to see the number underneath. Holding the card up to a bright light also allowed us to see the number through the photo, but we needed to remove the photo so we could provide a copy of the card in our application. We wonder if this has happened to anyone else! The photo below is an example of a Form I-94 card that looks the most similar to the one we received.\n\n[Example Form I-94 \\(Source: https:\\/\\/help.asylumadvocacy.org\\/parole-document\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0y9qmo34ogac1.jpg?width=723&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db7f8df859fe27f16cc90fa93cdd46f8da2f5ee1)\n\n**Forms Filed (All supporting documents are color copies unless otherwise stated)**\n\n* Form I-131\n* 2 Passport-style Photos\n* Marriage Certificate\n* Military Dependent Card\n* Military Card\n\n**Forms requested by RFE**\n\n* Military service member's statement explaining the reason for requesting PIP\n\n# Adjustment of Status (AOS)\n\nAfter receiving the Form I-94 for the PIP, we filed for AOS ourselves. However, if we didn't have the time to fill our the forms or had any doubts about our case, we would have absolutely found a reputable immigration firm to help us. Luckily, most information is readily accessible online, and the only thing that we really sacrificed was time (and sometimes our sanity).\n\n**Forms Filed (All supporting documents are color copies unless otherwise stated)**\n\n* ***Form I-130 Packet:***\n   * Form I-130\n   * Form I-130A\n   * 2 Passport-style Photos of Petitioner\n   * 2 Passport-style Photos of Beneficiary\n   * Petitioner's Birth Certificate\n   * Petitioner's Passport\n   * Beneficiary's Form I-94 (Parole in Place)\n   * Marriage Certificate\n   * Joint Residential Lease\n   * Joint Bank Account Statement\n   * Joint Auto Insurance\n   * Joint Photos\n* ***Form I-485 Packet:***\n   * Form I-485\n   * 2 Passport-style Photos of Beneficiary\n   * Beneficiary's Passport\n   * Beneficiary's Birth Certificate with Translation\n   * Beneficiary's Form I-94 (Parole in Place)\n   * Beneficiary's Driver's License\n   * Beneficiary's Military Dependent Card\n* ***Form I-864 Packet:***\n   * Form I-864\n   * IRS 1040 for 2022 for Petitioner and Beneficiary\n   * Petitioner's W-2 for 2022\n   * Beneficiary's W-2 for 2022\n   * Petitioner's Military Card\n   * Petitioner's Birth Certificate\n   * Petitioner's Passport\n* ***Form I-693 (Sealed)***\n\nWe wish for the best for everyone, and we are thankful to start off the new year on a high note!

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!  I just want to share my experience with you all because I love reading these :)\n\nI came to the US with my parents when I was 3 with a visitor VISA (we overstayed).  I've been undocumented, but that hasn't stopped me! I attended a top University in 2010 as an undocumented student until DACA was passed in 2012 (still \"undocumented\" but at least I can work!  I immediately applied and was approved in 2013. Every two years since I renewed my DACA- I always completed these myself & am happy to help anyone or answer any questions! :)  I am now in tech sales (have been for 7 years, and I am 30 btw).  \n\nI met my partner in 2021, and we got married in July 2022.  He was happy to start the process with me!  I looked at all of the forms for AOS- I-130, 1-131, I-485, I-864 and shopped around some attorneys.  They were charging 6k JUST for advanced parole (in LA) -\\_\\_-, in my opinion, that is ridiculous.  So I decided to do it myself! Below is my timeline. \n\n1. **Submitted form I-130 on 11/29/2022 ONLINE.**  \n\nIncluded:\n\n* 11 photos of us \n* marriage certificate\n* copy of husband's (US CITIZEN) passport\n* copy of his birth certificate\n* marriage license\n* 1 affidavit from my best friend \n* our lease\n* copy of our marriage license\n* Passport-style photos of both of us\n* copy of one joint investment account (very little money)\n   * In hindsight- I think I could've built a much stronger case with more photos, and more financials together (bank, insurance, utility bills etc) however, my application was accepted with no RFEs. \n\n**2. Submitted form I-131 on 12/05/2022 via mail ( advanced parole)** \n\n**VERY IMPORTANT STEP IF YOU HAVE NO RECORD OF COMING INTO THE COUNTRY WITH A BORDER CHECK. Using advanced parole as DACA provides you with a I-94 (arrival- departure) record that is necessary for I-485.**\n\n* form I-131\n* money order\n* two passport style photos\n* statement explaining purpose of travel (to visit my ill maternal grandmother)\n* copy of DACA approval notice (form I-797)\n* Copy of current EAD\n* MY birth certificate WITH translation (I use an online service called [rushtranslate.com](https://rushtranslate.com) for all of these)\n* my mother's birth certificate WITH translation (this is to prove my grandmother is my grandmother)\n* a letter on hospital letterhead signed and dated by doctor- this outlines all of her ailments, her history with diabetes, melanoma, her old age etc etc- it is addressed to USCIS and ends with her doctor's recommendation that she cannot travel at all.  WITH translation.\n* a  personal statement outlining why I would like to see my grandmother, that I am worried she will pass away without seeing me again, etc etc. \n   * **APPROVED ON 03/18/2023** for one month (I went to Mexico and came back a week before it expired). I went through customs, was taken back for additional inspection, they asked me a few questions and stamped my document and passport and I went on my way.  \n   * I later printed my I-94 online [https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)\n\n**3.  Submitted a PACKET for AOS on 05/19/2023 including the following:** \n\n* I-485 filing fee\n* Receipt notice for I-130 (since we submitted this first and not together)\n* completed signed and sealed medical I-693\n* I-485- complete and signed\n* 2 passport style photos\n* copy of my (beneficiary) passport\n* copy of my birth certificate WITH translation\n* Copy of my I-94 (arrival-departure record from above)\n\nAs far as my affidavit for support- I requested an exemption because I qualify for one. \n\n* cover letter saying I request an exemption\n* completed and signed form I-864W\n* SSA (social security administration) statement of beneficiary (this document can be checked and requested on the SSA website- it calculates if you have worked enough to qualify for SS.  This takes 40 credits. \n* Statement of NON-receipt of public benefits of the beneficiary (me)- this can also be pulled from the SSA website. \n\n**I sent in another I-131 (advanced parole request) but this is still in review.** \n\n**I never received any RFEs.**\n\n**I received a notice for our interview on November 14th- the interview was scheduled for December 14th- then they rescheduled it for the 13th.**  ***That's this Wednesday- STAND BY!*** \n\nokay bye!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

He was given 221g and DS5535 because his visa category was changed. Civil documents and a new DS-260 were needed from my side. \n\nWe submitted all the required civil documents on the CEAC website as instructed. \nI read the form they gave him and it says submit all required ORIGINAL documents. Now do they mean birth cert, marriage cert, police clearance etc? Documents we already submitted on CEAC? \n\nOn the CEAC website the documents we uploaded still says submitted and hasn’t changed to accepted yet. \n\nTried calling and emailing to just make sure what we need to do and if we need to courier the docs but haven’t gotten a reply. Thought I’d ask here. \n\nThankyou",

        "selftext": "Hay there, everyone.\nI’m a very anxious person to begin with so I figured I’d let you all know my timeline to help other anxious individuals. (Please use this information for an approximate estimate and not a true estimate as timelines may vary.)\n\nWe sent in our documents the first week of February 2022, but got our packet back after an additional 2 weeks because of payment issues, we had to figure that out then were able to send it back first week of March 2022 and heard back from NVC after another 2 weeks.\n\nAfter this we simply waited to get papers together and build up more of a fund for any fees needed for the trip. During this time we got approved by USCIS in April or 2023.\n\nWe sent in additional paperwork June of 2023 and finally heard back from NVC in September of 2023.\n\nIn the email from September of 2023 we were given our interview appointment date and additional instruction to make sure we were ready for things like booking the medical appointment, making sure we had the proper papers to bring in and booking flights and hotel for the time we were needing to stay in Montreal.\n\nAs of now I have had my medical. It lasted roughly 2.5 hours, I needed to get 1 vaccine(an additional chicken poxx), blood drawn, X-ray and a pee test done as well as a physical. All very short procedures with 3 different people. My vaccine location had a slight reaction of discomfort and irritation but no fever or break out and my interview is on November 2nd and will update you all when I can.\n\nWE GOT ACCEPTED!!\n\nSo I got to the building at 9:30 for my appointment at 9:45. They give you a small piece of paper with a number and your are supposed to go to the window assigned when your number pops up on the screen they have. I was able to go right away, giving my birth certificate, photo and passport as well as questions that I had took about 10ish minutes if that. They then had me sit in waiting for about an hour and 30 and had like a 3 minute conversation before they told me I was accepted and good to go. so about 2 hours total.\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nSo my passport was sent out (back home) a day after my appointment, went super well and the passport actually beat me home by like 6 days.\nOn top of that besides weather conditions messing up my flying schedule things also went really well. Slight storm delay, but hay! what can you do.\n\nGreen card arrived roughly 2 months after my landing date. But was sent the wrong card. Waiting to hear back from them (Hopefully by the 8th of April)\n\nHope this helps!",

        "selftext": "Hello, to explain my situation, i have a biological father who has been a US citizen thru naturalization before I was born.  I was born abroad and my dad what he says “forgot to report my birth to US”?? I honestly don’t know how to explain it in more professional way haha.  I got my green card back in 2012 when I was a teenager and this year I applied for naturalization for citizenship but got denied, and USCIS notified me that apparently it was already denied in 2016 which I had no idea about.  So i sent my i290B form to reopen to the office last month but there has been no update on USCIS website on my account about receiving it, or needing my payment yet so hoping I just need to be patient with that.  While waiting that to process I couldn’t resist this anxiety so I made a reddit account to research further more.  Then I saw this one post that was pretty similar to my situation and some of the comment recommended to apply for the U.S passport and that kind of clicked in my head because when I got my green card, the agent who interviewed me told my dad that I could apply for passport and if I get it I wouldn’t have to file n600?? But mine got denied.  \nSo I want to know if I apply for U.S passport, is it given for me that it will be denied? Or worth a chance?\nAlso how long does I290B take to even make record on my account? Or did I file it wrong? Haha\nAny advise would be appreciated, thank you in advance!",

        "selftext": "Good Morning,\n      First thank you to this community - I’ve already learned so much, I just wanted to share where we have started and get some feedback.\n      I am from the US (citizen/born) and have been a resident in Mexico for 3 years (official resident).  I work for an airline, and I met my husband in December 2021.  We married in June ‘23 and applied for I130 in July 3,2023. I know we will have a year or so wait, but that’s expected .  We live with his parents in Mexico City,\nWhen I applied I used the online systems , it was pretty straight forward processed although I did notice it populated address dates a little weird when I clicked the electronic filed version of the i130. I expected it may have been an issue , so before I submitted I included an explanation of how I own a home in Mexico and the USA and commute between the countries and clarified we live together in Mexico City. \n    He is a doctor here, and luckily my routes with my job give me layovers here in Mexico City .  When it came to evidence I threw everything but the kitchen sink at them, including not only photos, and letters all the usual but copies of him being the beneficiary on everything from my life insurance to my 401k and will. He has very little so there isn’t much he could submit , but  I am blessed to know that he will be taken care of if something happens to me. I even submitted a translated letter from the Mexican Government Institute of Nacional Migration (USCIS Mexican equivalent), that acknowledged that my civil status changed from single to married to a Mexican National. I even documented every single flight for work and flight for commuting and pleasure to Mexico City . Literally hundreds. We even went to the US consulate here in Mexico City and swore an affidavit from my company that we are domestic partners  so he may enjoy some of my flight benefits .\n   I intend to continue to update photos documents and evidence each month as they allow it on the website (USCIS). I will be moving back to USA in spring or fall of 2024 at the latest so there may be a time when we are separated but we are doing everything we can to avoid any pitfalls. I am going to finish nursing school. \n  I have read so many amazing storied on here, and hope to join the many successes. We did not use an attorney but plan to tap one if need be. The I130 with consular processing has really turned out to be the best option for us , because he can continue to work here and I can be here, I really look forward to bringing him home and he can begin the process of becoming a physician in the USA.\n Neither of us have any criminal records and he’s never been to the USA thus no immigration issues. \nWhen we got married Mexico City did put my last name as the name on my birth certificate , but I was married and got a divorce before (to a US citizen) so I have a hyphenated last name now. So I had to get my previous marriage license apostilled and translated into Spanish so CDMX can correct it , and I will submit that to USCIS. I’m trying to think of everything possible to avoid any issues. \n\nSo what do you think ? Any comments and questions are welcome. THANK YOU again for sharing your happiness and heart aches, we’re all in this together.",

        "selftext": "Hello r/USCIS,\n\nI am assembling a citizenship claim for my spouse under INA 309 (c), for which I need to demonstrate continuous physical presence of her mother (deceased) for one year any time prior to my spouse's birth.\n\nI have largely assembled the case, believe I have met the required burden of proof, and am preparing to submit it to the Consulate. That said, additional opinions as to if I have gathered enough evidence for physical presence would be helpful.\n\nThe transmitting US citizen parent (mother) spent the first seven years of her life in the USA. Given this young age, I have not been able to gather much in the way of direct evidence regarding the transmitting parent. However, I have established by way of subsequent birth certificates and a tax lien document the physical presence the transmitting parent's mother over a period of time.\n\nThe best evidence I have are documentation of the divorce proceedings of the transmitting parent's parents. The first document, dated October 1966 is an interlocutory judgement of divorce which names the transmitting parent, and orders her into the \"care, custody, and control\" of her mother. The second document, dated September 1967 is a final judgement of divorce and reaffirms the custody of the transmitting parent to the mother. The final document, dated August 1967, is a modification of the final judgement of divorce. It outlines the current circumstances of the two parents (including the living arrangements of the transmitting parent and her mother, and the fact that her mother could not obtain employment due to caring for the children), indicates neither parent are in violation any previous judgements, and grants custody of the transmitting parent to the father.  \n\n\nGiven these are court documents that outline that the transmitting parent was in the custody of an individual who was clearly present in the USA over two year period, in addition to the pattern of evidence of physical presence leading up to these events, I believe this is pretty strong evidence. Am I correct in this assessment? I understand that the standard of proof in this case is the preponderance of the evidence. Considering that fact, I can't fathom how that burden hasn't been met, but I'm willing to be told otherwise in which case, I will attempt to gather more evidence.\n\nThank!",

I filed out the application for CRBA online and choosed Mexico city as interview location, made the payment online. Few days later I received an email from U.S Embassy in Mexico city with interview appointment date scheduled in August(application was filled  in May), I tried to get earlier appointment but they told me that there is no earlier appointment that I can try to see if other consulate have opening , I checked the online system and we were lucky to find May 26 appointment at the U.S consulate in Merida.Scheduled another interview and asked Merida to request that Mexico city transferred our online application to Merida, they did and we went for the interview with all documents, officer at the interview told us that everything was fine and we request for an emergency passport for our daughter, the U.S passport was issued the same day, officer told us that our approved documents will be transferred to Mexico city for them to issue the CRBA since the online payment was made to them. In July I received email from U.S embassy in Mexico city asking for more proof of presence in the U.S, I sent 6 years of my credit card bills and also my bank statement as requested, few days later they contacted me and ask for more proof like travel history, I sent them record from the CBP with travel record from 2011-2021 (that was what FOIA/CBP sent me) Yesterday I received a call from them again that the assistant consul still need more documents but they did not say which documents. My question is, is this normal? My daughter already have a U.S emergency passport issued by the U.S consulate in Merida Mexico and valid for 1year, can the officer at the U.S embassy in Mexico city denied my daughter's CRBA application even though she already have a U.S passport? I got my citizenship last year and I travel on business trips from time to time but maintain physical presence in the U.S.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone! \n\nSo I'm doing everything in one swoop and have spent endless hours reading various blogs (shout out to mexicorelocationguide and mexperience), reddit posts and government pages, both for getting residency and moving down. There's quite a bit of outdated and conflicting info so I just wanted to see if my plan / understanding has any glaring holes in it or if there's a better way to do something. \n\nThanks in advance for any help! Also sorry so much in post but it seemed better than several specific ones, so i'll group by step.\n\nBasic overview: \n\n* read / speak decent spanish but have trouble understanding when people speak fast (was in MX for 6 months a few years ago, lived in Spain or a few months, etc)  \n* have temporary residency visa\n* driving into Mexico with dad (just helping) and dog in my truck pulling cargo trailer (in 2 weeks or so) \n* looking to rent a place in CDMX\n\n  \nCrossing Border\n\n* Plan on crossing at Columbia bridge north of Laredo (better for trailers & avoid Tamaulipas); will cross on a weekday morning\n* Duty/Customs: researched doing the official Menaje de Casa but seems like extra steps to pay a similar amount (don't have too much stuff) and have lots of restrictions. Still going to label / number the boxes and have a detailed manifest to show.\n* FMM/TIP: initially was going to do online beforehand but now planning on doing at border (importance of making sure it's stamped as Caje instead of visitante & seems fairly easy). Will have registrations & copies of everything.\n* Dog: I'll have a rabies / good health certificate. \n   * Q: You're supposed to stop at SENESICA / SAGARPA to have the dog inspected but seems like nobody really does? I've also read some people say those staff are onnly at airports and not land borders. Not sure if I should worry about it.\n\nDriving to CDMX\n\n* Current plan is kinda to just get to CDMX asap - especially with a trailer. \n   * Q: Not sure if I'm trying to go too fast and/or if it's worth spending an extra day or two to check out interesting cities along the way. Ex: Guanajuato, aguascalientes, etc\n* That plan:\n   * Stay the night in Monterrey after crossing border\n   * Next day drive to and stay in San Luis Potosi\n   * Next day drive to CDMX\n* There's an RV park (Pepe's) north of the city I'll plan on leaving the trailer and maybe the truck until I have a place rented\n* Besides the usual tips of only driving during day, use toll roads, under speed limit - how should i prepare for any potential police shakedowns?\n   * Q: Should I always refuse to pay and say take us to the station? Or maybe just have a certain amount of $ handy ($50?) I can offer after some arguing and haggling?\n\n  \nCanje\n\n* Going to get an airbnb in CDMX for 2 or so weeks initially, to complete Canje and find a place to rent. Can always book another if needed.\n* While I could probably do the whole Canje process myself, I'd rather hire an immigration facilitator to get the appointment and make sure everything is correct the 1st time.\n   * Q: Does anyone have recommendations / contact info for a facilitator? How much do they cost?\n   * Q: I'm guessing I should wait for them to help fill out the official immigration forms?\n*  Most lists of needed documents have the normal items (FMM, passport, visa, letter, bank statements, immigration forms, etc) \n   * Q: However I've also references to a myriad of other potential documents like birth certificates (apostilled, translated, etc) and people having to fly back to the US, etc? I just want to make sure I have everything.\n\nRenting a place\n\n* Looking to rent a 2 bedroom flat somewhere in the usual areas (Roma nte, Polanco, Juarez, Rosa, etc) for 12 or possibly 6 months. Also have a dog.\n* I was first planning on connecting and meeting up with local expat group(s) as I assume they would have connections / recommendations with access to better places than just using websites\n   * Q: There's a bunch of different sites listing places for rent but not sure if there's one or two that are the best to use?\n* Finding / renting a place\n   * Q: Is it recommended to use some kind of realtor to do this process or is it fine doing it on your own?\n   * Q: Is it reasonable to expect to be able to move in to a place with in a week or two of signing a lease / etc? Or is there some bureaucratic process that drags it all out?\n   * Q: Everybody from CDMX I've talked to in the US has told me to have a Mexican friend do the initial call / get rent prices / etc as they will automatically jack the rates up if they know I'm a gringo. Is that a thing and how would that work? I feel like they would know as soon as I went to look at the place but maybe they usually honor the initial rate? Not trying to scam anyone but not trying to get scammed either.\n\nThanks again for any help or advice!! \n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "I live in Denver and am planning to move to Mexico with my wife and two kids. I want to apply for temp residency with my qualifying income (i.e the amount is high enough for all four of us). My employer has given me permission to work remotely from Mexico.\n\nHowever, I’ve only had my current job since early November, 2024. So I won’t have six months of steady qualifying income until May, and we’re hoping to move this summer. So I’d like to avoid consulates that require 12 months of qualifying income if possible.\n\nThe Denver consulate, for whatever reason, refuses to consider income for temp residency. They will only look at 12 months of qualifying savings, which must be liquid (i.e. IRAs, 401k’s, etc. don’t qualify). They told me all this over several emails back and forth recently. So I can’t go to my local consulate.\n\nIt looks like Las Vegas could work, but they seem pretty booked up. They said I’m on a waitlist but I’m not going to hold my breath there.\n\nIt also looks like Phoenix could work and maybe San Diego. But I haven’t gotten a reply from the scheduling email I sent the former and the latter uses this citas.gob.mx website to schedule appointments and I cannot for the life of me get that thing to work. Are others using that successfully? If so, are you logging in using the Llave MX thing or just email and password?\n\nANYway my real question is which other consulates should I be looking at? Has anyone had recent success getting TR with these qualifications at other consulates?\n\n¡Gracias!",

He is a Mexican citizen, and I am a US citizen.\n\nI have multiple name changes through court orders, and one due to a previous marriage. The thing that concerns me most is that my most recent name change via court order has a different first and last name than my marriage certificate because I wanted to revert to my old first and middle name and only take one of my husband's surnames rather than both.  The probate court will not update it. My birth certificate also has a completely different name, but I have the complete paper trail of my name changes. Has anyone had issues with this when dealing with trying to get the Family Unity TR through the consulate in the US? If it's approved in the US, will I have issues completing the visa processing when I get to Mexico?\n\nI also have a document from another country that I may or may not need to present. I know I need the apostille, but from what I understand,  the translation of the document happens after the apostille and can be done anywhere as long as it's one of the approved, certified Mexican translators, correct?\n\nThanks for the help.\n",

I've learned a lot just from the responses I've gotten so far.\\\\\n* I understand that the community has a restriction on politics. Let me just say, this is something my husband and I have talked about doing extensively in the past, but we feel that it might be necessary to make those tentative plans a reality in a shorter order than we intended.\n* My husband has a job and makes roughly $84k a year gross. We would not be looking to retire. However, I'm currently unemployed. My hope had been to find a job there, but I understand the restriction; I'll have to give that some thought. \n* I do speak a little Spanish - I took about 5 years through high school/college but I never had an opportunity to do any immersive learning (I grew up in southern Indiana and there weren't many people fluent in Spanish) so a lot of it didn't stick. My husband grew up in Arizona and knows about as much as I remember. But learning the local language of wherever we move would be a priority.\n\nThis has given me a lot to chew on, and at a time when my mouth is already full :/ Thank you everyone",

Pretty sure we can’t afford Polanco based on my research. We have been told about the Providencia and Chapalita in Guadalajara but the public transit is warding us off. Same with Monterrey in general. Would love to know if this is true.\n\nWe can probably swing upwards MXN 40,000 a month for rent but would like to keep it below that given we will have to pay private school tuition.\n\nWe don’t speak Spanish (yet) but my spouse is ahead of me, having taken it in school albeit many years ago. \n\nWe have a few outstanding questions! \n\nLocations: I’d love to hear from you about our location finalists. Is there somewhere we didn’t consider that we should? Is one of those finalists a bad idea?\n\nFinances: We prefer to live below our means, which is how we can afford an international move in the first place. I know I’ll have to source health care in Mexico since my health insurance through work will be invalid there, but even considering that cost, I think my income more than covers typical living expenses for a family of three. Is this accurate?\n\nTaxes: I’m probably going to need an accountant’s advice who is familiar with ex-pats on temporary residency visa keeping their US-based jobs. Do you have one to recommend? \n\nRenting: Once we narrow down our area, we’re not sure if it makes sense to hire a real estate agent to take us around to apartments once we arrive, or if I should go down first to scout and sign a lease, or something else? We can probably swing an AirBNB for a month or two if we have to, but since we want to ship household items and we’ll be in Mexico 1-4 years (and permanently if we love it!) we don’t want to be bouncing around and we’ll need a place to ship our household items. \n\nTransportation: We have a perfectly fine car, but it seems impractical to get it to Mexico, since we live more than 1,000 miles from the border. We can’t drive it, and shipping it seems exorbitant. Can we get along without a car in our desired location(s)? Should we be looking at budgeting to buy a car in Mexico?\n\nEducation: Since we’re likely moving in the middle of a school year, we figure on “home schooling” to finish out the school year, and then enrolling our kid in local elementary school in the fall. We like the idea of enrolling in an international school, and are nervous about ADHD supports. We welcome any advice about schooling for English-speaking kids with ADHD particularly in the locations we’re considering. We’re also open to specific school recommendations.\n\nThe Awkward Stuff: We know our Spanish isn’t good yet, and certainly won’t be ‘bureaucracy-good’ for a while. We’re willing to spend money on helpers/translators that are trustworthy to help get us settled in. I’d love to get some referrals or hear your experiences with this type of service. While there are concierge services geared towards the ultra-wealthy, we are not that. Very willing to pay a local or another ex-pat though, is this a service that exists?",

        "selftext": "Wanted to share our experience successfully receiving TR via economic solvency and TR via family unification in CDMX this past week.\n\nI’ll skip everything pre-arrival in Mexico, except for noting that only one spouse applied for and received a TR visa in the US with our plan always being to apply for family unification.\n\nDay 1 - Arrived at INM at 730AM to handover passport and sign documents with hired facilitator. Grabbed breakfast nearby and waited to hear what time my appointment would be.\n\nAt about 930, I was told I had an appt at 11 and to be back at INM by 1045. Waited outside in the courtyard near the fountains until 1pm when I was finally ushered to the payment counter by my facilitator.\n\nAfter paying, I was handed a single piece of paper and asked to wait near an office where I was promptly assisted and given a second piece of paper to take upstairs. On the top floor, it’s similar to a DMV with a bunch of counters and biometric stations.\n\nMy documents were submitted and in a couple mins my name was called for processing. Fingerprints, signature, photos. Card was printed in less than 5 mins and I was on my way back to our Airbnb by 2pm.\n\nDay 2 - My facilitator knew we wanted the family unification appointment to be on day 3, but they failed to tell me that they would need my spouse and child’s passports on day 2 in order to make the appointment. So, I had to bring the passports to INM on day 2 at 9am. I was told I would know the appointment time for the following day by 3pm (when INM starts to close for the day), but that wasn’t the case. My facilitator kept our passports overnight (with my prior permission)\n\nDay 3 - at 8am, I was told we should all arrive at 1145 for our 12 appt. We hung out in the courtyard until 230 when my wife and child had to go in alone with my facilitator to make four separate payments (1705 per person for the review + 5328 per person for the 1 yr TRs). \n\nThey were then inside for what felt like an hour and our facilitator said we would need to come back the next day for their biometrics. At 3pm, I was told I would need to leave the courtyard.\n\nAt around 330, my spouse exited, but quickly explained that the immigration officer had only provided the paperwork for herself but not our child. Our facilitator took everything back inside by himself and after a few minutes he came out and shook his head saying we would have to get that tomorrow even though it is such a simple task after you’ve paid the fees.\n\nDay 4 - Since the family unification TRs had already been approved and we just needed the paperwork for our child plus biometrics, we were told we could come anytime and it should only be 30 mins tops. We settled on 9am and my spouse and child quickly went inside. This time they had to wait somewhere on the opposite side of the floor so I didn’t have any visibility of when they made it upstairs for biometrics, but they were finished in about an hour and a half.\n\nDay 5 - Only thing to note is that the “IMN office” at CDMX in terminal 2 for receiving an exit stamp is just a information kiosk that we actually missed since the signage points to a restaurant and the kiosk isn’t clearly marked on all sides. After backtracking, I quickly found it near the duty free store and HSBC/Citibanamex/Amex lounges.\n\n\n\nI was prepared for things to be slow and bureaucratic, and this is not a complaint since that would be too entitled, but it essentially took three full days to do an individual TR plus two family unity TRs. We felt the process was “easy” given our use of a facilitator, but draining with a toddler. We were each dealing with stomach bugs for one of the days and it rained every evening, so the trip was short of exploring/attractions.\n\nOne other note is that I never felt like I knew what our facilitator was doing or where they were. They were obviously inside waiting in lines, which I appreciate not having to do myself, but I don’t feel like the process was that well explained to us. I realize the INM rules dictate what they are not allowed to do, such as chaperoning us to biometrics, but I would ask for an update on where my spouse was in the process and they didn’t really know. \n\nNow we get to decide where to visit next summer to renew!\n\nHappy to answer any questions.

I am in the process of gathering documents to claim it, but I noticed that the names of my parents on my birth certificate and those of my parents don't match. For instance, in Mexico, it is common to use both of your parent's last names. My US birth certificate only has one. My worry is that my US birth certificate won't be accepted at all if the names don't match. I can't get a clear answer out of the consulate or my local records office, and I am willing to make those changes if possible.\n\nHas anyone else run into this problem and how was it fixed?

I'm looking to do so because my in-laws, both parents and a brother, are thinking of giving up their plan to become US citizens and just moving back down to Mexico. There is a lot going into this decision, and I'm not even sure where to begin.\n\nI am married to my husband (31M Mexican) who is a US citizen by birth and does not have Mexican citizenship, though I am trying to make him get it so this transition is easier. He alone does not earn enough to meet the financial obligations of moving, as the local consulate says they want proof of $5,000/month or the equivalent in savings. I have not been working due to a multitude of health issues (osteoporosis and psoriasis related health conditions, as well as a back injury) and do not believe I'll be able to earn enough doing side jobs to help us towards this goal.\n\nAm I going to be denied a visa due to the financial insufficiency? Or could I be denied due to my health problems? Our local mexican consulate never answers the phones and is booked out 6 months, so I can't even ask them for a very long time.\n\nAnd I know my husband and his family are thinking of opening a restaurant/bar in Oaxaca when they get back. Is that something feasible? Can someone with a visa even be involved in that? Can it be done while being out of the country, or would they need a physical address in Mexico to do it? \n\nI'm struggling to find resources online about this, as most of it being opinions pieces rather than on if it's even worth moving to Mexico. And I'm stressing trying to line-up the financial plan before we even really think about leaving. Any and all tips/advice or otherwise is greatly appreciated!",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone:\n\nI am planning on trying to stay in Mexico for 6 months, starting closer to end of 2024. I am a US citizen and 41 years old. I tried to read through several similar posts about this, but wanted to see if my \"next steps\" are correct in moving forward. Note I spent 1 week in CDMX in September 2023 working remotely to \"try\" this out, and also spent two weeks there in 2018 for some business meetings and sightseeing. My goal is to try and go to both CDMX and Guadalajara. My next steps are as follows (with some questions):\n\n1) Try to find an air bnb starting around late October 2024 or January 2025 if I need a bit more time to prepare. Though I want to stay for six months, I will probably try and reserve something for about 2 months first, in case I want to change locations. \n\n2) Given that I may change locations while there, do I just use the initial air bnb address as my place of stay when submitting any immigration documents upon entering the country?\n\n3) I will be working from my computer the whole time. If I am asked why I am coming into the country for so long, should I just say vacation or can I up front say I plan to just work from my computer? I know some countries are very hard on this, which is why I ask (for example, the UK or Ireland).\n\n4) Is there any chance that even if I state I will stay for 5-6 months that they stamp me for less? When I went in Sept 2023, they stamped me for only 3 months, but that may have been because I said I was staying for only one week.\n\n5) Does anyone have any experience receiving mail at their temporary Mexican residence, which may be forwarded from relatives back in the US? I have some concerns mail may not make it to an air bnb. \n\n6) If I leave the country temporarily during the six month stay (for example, if I need to go back to the US for business or to go see a relative), has anyone had bad experiences trying to get back in if still within the stamped time frame? \n\n7) Has anyone had any difficulty utilizing their US bank accounts while from MX? I plan to just withdraw funds from Mexican ATMs or tellers where needed, but otherwise use credit cards. \n\nThanks for any advice.   \n",

Make sure you print out the right one, because it is very easy to get wrong. This is the one you need:https://www.inm.gob.mx/tramites/publico/solicitud\\_estancia.html\n   1. In the first field select: Cambiar condición de etancia. \n   2. in the second field select: Cambio condicion a residente temporal por unidad familiar\n   3. fill it out completely\n   4. If you bring the wrong form, they won't print out the correct one. You will have to leave, print it, and come back.\n2. Your name. This seems simple, but it's confusing. In Mexico, you have a first name or names, and then your maternal and paternal last name. In the USA, we usually have a first, middle, and last name. I have learned that your Nobre is your First AND Middle name. Your Apellido is your last name. Don't combine middle and last. More confusing yet, is that sometimes maternal and paternal last name are called \"primer apellido\" and \"segundo apellido\" or something similar. Don't put your middle and last there either. Your last name is your apellido (usually your father's, unless you do a hyphenated situation). So Nombre: First and Middle. Apellido: Last name. This WILL save you headaches on all manner of forms.\n3. Passport with stamp that replaces the FMM. Note that even though most airports aren't using the physical FMM form anymore, they require one. The good news for me was that the INM was used to this, and was ready to print one out for me, no problem. She didn't even ask me for one, she just automatically printed one. \n4. Spouse Mexican Passport\n5. Apostilled Marriage Certificate\n   1. And official translation if USA or other foreign certificate\n6. Spouse Passport\n7. Copies, only needed one copy each of\n   1. Your passport\n   2. Mexican spouse passport\n   3. Marriage License with Apostille \n   4. Translated Marriage License with Apostille\n8. Debit or Credit card for 2 payments, one to look at documents, one to issue the temporary residency permit\n9. A form they gave me that my spouse agrees we're really together, etc... It's a single page attestation that you can pre-fill here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nM1utBVjOehQeD7k2BPr5WPYsdODS9j7/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nM1utBVjOehQeD7k2BPr5WPYsdODS9j7/view)\n\n<<<<<<<<   SIGNATURES MUST MATCH PASSPORT SIGNATURES. >>>>>>>>\n\n\n\nWhat I was told I needed but DID NOT NEED, WAS NOT ASKED FOR\n\n1. Birth Certificates of any kind from either party\n2. Proof of residence- lease, bills, etc\n3. Spouse INE\n4. More than one copy \n5. Prepaid Pago de Derechos receipts(you can do this at the bank if you want like I did, but you can just pay at the counter now)\n6. Photographs\n7. A lawyer\n\nI spent a considerable amount of extra money on apostilled birth certificates and translations, copies of my lease, copies of bills, and multiple sets of copies for everything. I didn't need any of it in Puebla, nor did anyone else (I was in a front seat and could see the process for others). \n\nIt is maddeningly slow. The process, more or less:\n\nThey open at 9AM\n\nI arrived at 6AM and was third in line. Once I got in, I was seen at around 9:45 and told I had the wrong tramite. The nice lady explained (in English) the correct one, showed my on her computer how to get it, and gave me a paper with all of the requirements. I told her I'd be back later that day. I found a copy shop that's about a block from the INM. I was able to fill out the right form on my phone, save the pdf and email it to the copy shop to print. I went back, and had to wait about 45 minutes in line to get back in. It took me about 1.5 hours to get back up to the window, and everything seemed fine. About 2 hours later they called me up and told me my spouses signature didn't totally match the signature on the attestation, so I called her from the cafe she was at and she fixed it. Then it was another 3 hours until I was seen for my photograph. I received my card about 1.5 hours after that. \n\nIt was a stressful, long day, but I left with my temporary resident card, and we went out for a couple of negronis. \n\nMake sure you have the right forms the first time, make sure all of your signatures match. Make sure your name is in the correct format, and you'll be out in a day. Then you are clear for a couple of years until it's time to get a permanent card. ",

        "selftext": "Edit: Forgot to say hello. Hello!\n\nPlanning a move to Mexico, and trying to narrow down a location. Budget is about $1000/month + occasional/emergency expenses. I'm working on my Spanish, which is currently \"survival\" level (asking for directions, paying for stuff, ordering food, small talk), and want to eventually become fluent. I am a musician, and want to rent a place that will allow me to play music (sometimes loud), eat, sleep, shower, and have internet access, with a minimum of 10\\^2 meters of living space not including the bathroom. Loud neighbors don't bother me at all. At any given time I might be doing something as loud as playing a drum kit, but usually quieter than that. I don't have any expensive habits, and am fine with any kind of local food or cooking at home.\n\nMexico is a big place, so I'm sure there are lots of places that would fit this bill. Access to an expat community would be great, but I also want to be able to learn and enjoy the local culture.\n\nVery interested in hearing your case for one town/city or another. This will help me narrow my research. I've heard great things about so many places!",

        "selftext": "I just want to openly debate and offer my perspective as lived experience, immigrant myself coming into this country in 2012 legally. I dont get why a lot of people support illegal immigration policies and open borders. \n\nThis is not a troll or anything, I want to understand and have genuine discourse which I think we lack lately as people are quick to jump conclusions and paint others with right/left/center/racist/facist or whater you want. \n\nLet me give you a few details of how legal immigration works(from my experience) and then I would write an arguments why it needs to be overhauled, but not with opening borders as its bad for the country and bad for people coming over here illegally. \n\nI came to the US in 2012. I had to submit any imaginable paperwork living person can conjure, birth certificate, passport, background checks, my education, high school diploma, collage, my work experience, references, etc. \n\nFirst interview was in my country in the US embassy, questions about my past and current allegiance, why I was going, and even stupid ones which I thought was silly - are you going to try destabilize the USA government? Are you part of terrorist organization? (I was like even if someone was trying who would say yes lol). Anyway, many forms followed, my biometric pictures, finger prints(I guess for extra background check), sponsors here, their recommendations, etc. Very long process. Finally, the last part after I was approved to come over was my vaccination documents from childhood, I had to submit them and any vaccines my country might not required or by USA standards needed boosting I had to get in the US embassy approved clinic before leaving. \n\nComing into JFK was another stop for my photo, fingerprints. When in the USA, I was called into immigration center for another interview, few weeks or month or so later I got my ssn card and green card, which gave me permission to work. I started applying to jobs and from here normal story you have heard probably millions times. I dont want to retell all my struggles or diminish any others but it is a story you probably familiar  with, very real by the way. Anyway that is not the point of my post. All immigrants go through this one way or another, how hard it is to leave family, friends, integrate into different country, language issues/accent, etc etc.\n\nI had one more interview about one year been here, more like touch point what I was doing etc.  Two years later I had to resubmit some of what I have been doing in the country, one more interview with background check from my local sheriff's office (I am sure they did more background checks themselves to make sure I was not involved in any criminal activity) thats when I was granted permanent green card. After holding permanent green card for over 5 years, I went and passed exam for citizenship and got naturalized. \n\nNow my perspective on the process pros: \n1) You are screen so deliberately and carefully that it is almost impossible to come over in the USA for any ill intent. Criminal record pretty much gets you automatic denial(I had none, so not sure exactly but many forms ask the question and you have yo go through multiple background checks). \n\n2) Again, screening is so intense that you have yo provide your vaccination results from childhood to make sure no diseases are brought in the country. \n\n3) During the interviews and countless paperwork submissions, people are screened who would be functioning members of society, who can integrate well and bring good to the USA. (I never actually worked or known anyone close who works for immigration office, just this was my perspective as I was going through these myself).\n\n4) The whole process somewhat prepares you what to expect, you go through so much paperwork and interviews that you need to have basic knowledge of English. It is drilled into you that crime is bad(you cant come into the country with record). Moreover during the probationary period (temp green card you get before permanent) if you commit any crime you are going back to your country,  as you would lose your status.  \n\nCons: \nMy main problem with current process is how hard it is to go through it even if you are qualified or eligible. The paperwork, bureaucracy is insane. It is so tedious that many times I felt like giving up. You might have noticed how many times I had to submit paperwork, its not that mistyped and wrote it few times,  no if anything I missed more times I had to submit papers before interviews or afterwards, it is constant. \n\nInterviews are brutal, sometimes it feels like you are interrogated as if you are already guilty of something and you have to prove your innocence. Many immigration officers, workers are rude and sometimes assholes, not sure deliberately or not. I encountered dozens of workers for years and can only recall two people who I could say were nice. Again this is my perspective, can be a requirement for a job to screen criminals? To me many of them could have been nicer. \n\nCurrent limit on legal immigration is set to 650,000 a year I believe. If we needs more immigrants, then we need to losen requirements and make process easier. Make this number 1,000,000 and simplify the process and actually set people up for success. \n\n‐-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove I outlined my story, my perspective on legal immigration, here I will focus on illegal immigration and whats my perspective on this. \n\nFirst why it is bad for the USA: \n\n\n- Criminals, terrorist, bad people! Allowing everyone to come here, you will also let bad people come through in much more higher numbers than before. As I described due process above, even that can be gamed and criminals can forge the papers, lie on interview and all that but I hope you understand amount of effort they need to put in that process than here.\nAlso, let me explain why America has for a lucrative aspect for just every day criminals too. If you are in any other country stealing you will get less money than stealing in the USA for the same stuff. And many times USA has much more lenient laws than country of origin. \n\n\n- Living standard disparity between US and other countries encourages some people to sit on gov aid and do nothing, because it is much much better than where they came from. You want this or not it is true, I know many who do this.(Many would paint me as traitor to my community as immigrant myself but fact is fact and I want to give you my honest thoughts on this issue). \n\n\n- Health care much higher standard than some other countries. It is true that for working Americans most will not qualify for medicaid and healthcare can be very expensive but lot of people who came over jumped on medicaid. (trigger warning, probably I will be called names again for this but I know people who do this and are currently on it). \n\n\n- Vaccination and potential for bringing some diseases into the country, read my point above. People crossing over dont go through same scrutiny. \n\n\n- Empathy to the point where our country can be ruined. The most people who have not been outside the US, dont understand that 80-90% of the worlds countries have worst economies than USA or face some type of discrimination based on their sex, beliefs, orientation, list goes on. If you open up borders and let everyone who has financial difficulties come in, the country would be overrun. This means there is billion people right now who would leave everything and move if they could. \n\n\n- Lowering wages for certain industries. Many illegals are hired for exploitation and are paid cents on the dollar to do the work. This lowers overall wages for legal workers too and incentivizes those industries to hire illegals. \n\n\n- Making cartels and criminals super rich for smuggling people to the border. Again, because I am immigrant I personally know sooo many people who paid tens of thousands of dollars per person to get in the country. Now multiply this by millions, you get the idea. They can invest this money to better smuggle drugs and fund their nefarious activities, just common sense. \nIf you think that you can come over the border by yourself, without paying smugglers, you are wrong, in real life 99.9% coming over border had to pay up. \n\n\n- Overall illegal immigration is a net draw on the country and open borders are not sustainable. We can be accommodating for some time until we have massive collapse and massive issues which can not be rectified or we can take approach to overhaul legal process if more immigrants are needed and work on that part. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nSecond, why this is bad for people coming illegally: \n\n- There is a myth out there that you only need to get into the USA and that is it, people who come here without due process are not prepared. They can not integrate into society, they dont know English, they are not ready because to them hardest part was just crossing the border which is not true. It is very hard to be in the country, with no family, friends, no language or culture knowledge and then face extra pressure having no papers to get legal work. Because of this they are limited what they can do and this pressures them to do something they would have not done in their countries, it is especially hard for males. Fact is that females can get work  easier than males, I cant tell you how many males I know from my country who came here bright eyed spend all their life savings and sank into drugs and we had to send them back in caskets. \n\n- Work exploitation, when you are illegally hired you have no rights. Who do you complain when you are paid cents on a dollar? When you work 12-16 hours a day and get no overtime? When boss abuses you? Nobody, because the moment you say something you are out of the door or are threatened you will be reported to authorities and to get anothet job can take months. This is the point I dont understand people supporting saying, oh who will go and farm for you? Who will build houses for you? Who will clean streets for you? Who will care cheap for your grandparents? you are okay having cheap exploited labor to have cheap food, houses, goods and claim moral high ground? \n\n- People who come over here illegally are subjected to such horrors that some are impossible to imagine. Days in boats crossing lakes and ocean with just bread and water, days of hicking into swamps, forests, smuggled into stinky vans. Fear of seeing armed people in the countries escorting you somewhere you hope is the border and not some hole to be killed. I mean you should know someone who went through bad smuggling over the border to understand how bad it is. Not everyone goes to extreme difficult crossing as I described, but its easy for people to comment on issues like that who work 41 hour a week and take mental recover day next week because they worked 1 extra hour prior. I will be honest here most of you dont understand what they go through. \n\n- When administration of one or another first world country opens borders for illegal immigration, word gets out. I visited my country or origin in 2022 and I was flabbergasted how many strangers who I got to talk to were telling me were coming over. And they all thought hardest part was just getting through the border. The prevalent myth as I described above is you only need to get through the border to be successful. Most who I talked to had no knowledge of English or knew not what would they do when in the USA, I tried to explain but you have seen American dream in movies, hard to get people to understand its not all roses and rainbows. The story was completely different when I was back to my country in 2016, no one was talking coming over via Mexico most questions I got was how to apply for green card and if I could help some of my acquaintances and friends with forms which I did. \n\n‐----------------------\n\nLet me adress something where people can write that I contradict myself and that both my statements cant be true. \n\nI stated that many people come over here to game the system and stay latched on government support forever but I also stated that people coming over are exploited for work how can both be true? Because there are people who come over for gaming the system but there are also good, hard working, ambitions people who come here to do more and want even better lives(which are majority by the way). Only sad part is that from the beginning they are set up for failure, most of them spent last penny paying smugglers to get here, know no language and face extra challenges of having no papers. They are overworked and underpaid, their dreams crumble facing reality of dead end no pay jobs doing construction, cleaning, hospitality, care giving, etc. Thus many fall to drugs and other things they would have never done in their country of origin,  read my point again sending caskets back. \n\n-------------------------\n\nI whole heartedly support deporting:\n\n- Criminals of any type, I dont care if you stole a pair of socks in your country of origin (if you are found out to have a record back home) or here, you get deported period. \n\n- People who had social security numbers and work authorization given but have done nothing for years, are still sitting on government help programs pretending they are seeking the job. \n\n- People left after we got rid of the above groups are individuals who came here because of former administration's crime. Word got out borders were open and you could get in the US, as I described in my previous posts how many had to sell everything, pay last penny go through so many difficulties to cross over. While as adults they took responsibility and still knew they were coming illegally, administration encouraged it which is a tragedy. I personally know very good hard working people and this is why I am torn. One point they are illegally here but same time idiots from previous admin pushed message it was okay. I feel like I go in circles and circles on this point because I am truly torn. I dont know if some kind of help can be given to them but in the end they are here illegally and need to go back. I just wish whoever was responsible tricking them to come here would face justice causing so much pain and suffering, but I know it will never happen. I hope we just learn the lesson and never repeat this again, because as I described in general its not good for the country and for people coming here (There are very few exceptions but in general its negative all around). \n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis is my lived experience and my honest opinion why illegal emigration is overall bad for the country and also bad for most people who are coming over naively that everything is going to be great. \n\nI know I will get a lot of grief, but I dont care. Only one thing I ask, stay respectful to each other and lets have a dialog maybe we can change each others minds? Dont jump to conclusions. \n\nIf you made it all the way here I want to thank you, my English is not perfect nor did I proof read this or had AI correct it for me, I  just poured out my heart on the issue I am passionate about and want to know your honest opinion why would you support illegal immigration? How is this good for the country or people coming over? \n------------------------ ",

I just had a consultation with a lawyer to see what my options are for citizenship/green card, etc. \nA little about me:\nMy mother brought me here when I was 3 illegally from Mexico . I have 6 other brothers and sisters who are all American citizens. My mother lost custody of us due to neglect and abuse and we were placed in foster care where I was adopted in 2001 at the age of 12 by an American woman. I have a foreign birth certificate and a social. Fast forward to now. I’ve been married for 9months to an American citizen but have been with my husband for 10 years. We have 3 kids together.  I spoke with the lawyer full heartedly believing the lawyer would suggest my husband sponsor me but was very surprised to hear him say he’d like to try derivative citizenship. Would that actually apply to me? He also mentioned something about The Hague convention aide. If I’m spelling that correctly, idk it was a lot of information thrown at me pretty fast. I have another consultation in a couple weeks to be able to compare the paths suggested. Thank you in advance for reading and any potential help. God bless! \n \n",

I recently applied for the US passport and it was denied as I wasn’t able to establish legitimation. The letter seems to quote Kenyan legitimacy Act created in 1930 , I submitted documents and quoted the updated Kenyan children’s Act of 2012 which is more in line with when I migrated into the US. I have a sibling who we both came together and he applied for citizenship but was denied and told that he is already a citizen and he would have to apply for either the passport or certificate of citizenship. Online status shows the my passport application is still under additional information needed , but the letter says the passport was denied . I have an appointment set up to consult an immigration lawyer , more so looking for advice here what else I can do ? Can I still submit more documentation? Since they have returned all documents I have submitted for my application. \n\nDocuments I submitted are;\nForeign passport showing entry into the US in 2012 \nSchool records\nForeign birth certificate \nImmunization records as they needed documentation at my time of birth \nUS father naturalization certificate \nUS citizen father tax records \nMy W2 showing same address as my US citizen father \nDocumentation from a Kenyan lawyer quoting the updated children’s ACT of 2012, showing that legitimacy can be shown when father acknowledges paternity\nUS citizen father affidavit claiming paternity . \n",

        "selftext": "I was fortunate to marry a U.S. citizen and be petitioned in 2021. I had been a DACA recipient since April 2013, and I just arrived back home last night from my consular appointment in Juárez. Here’s how my process went from start to finish:\n\nFirst DACA Approval: 4/15/2013 \n\nMarried to USC: 12/18/2021 \n\nFiled I-130: 7/18/2022 \n\nReceived RFE and Submitted: 7/27/2022 \n\nI-130 Approved: 10/17/2023 \n\nReceived NVC Notice to Submit Paperwork/DS-260: 11/29/2023 \n\nReceived Consular Appointment: 11/25/2024\n\n**Consular Process:**\n\nDoctor & Biometrics Appointment: 1/24/2025 \n\n1st Consular Appointment (Paperwork Check): 1/29/2025 \n\n2nd Consular Appointment (Official Interview): 1/30/2025 \n\nReceived Email to Pick Up Passport at Embassy: 2/1/2025\n\n**Things to Note:** \n\nA lawyer guided me through the beginning of the process and helped me submit my I-130, which I mailed physically. After that, I used AI to assist with everything else.\n\nI did not apply for Advance Parole because I felt my process was already well underway and didn’t see the need to hire a lawyer for it. I also had no reason to believe USCIS would deny my case.\n\nI did not apply for a waiver because I only accumulated 88 days of unlawful presence in the U.S. I had 59 days from my 18th birthday to my first DACA approval. I also had a 29-day gap between my second and third DACA approvals, which was due to USCIS delays at the time.\n\nI was told by many that I did not need a police certificate since I was a child when I migrated from Mexico and had never returned. However, for peace of mind, I decided to get one while in Mexico. I requested it online and received a PDF via email within a few hours. The consulate returned the document to me and confirmed that I did not need it.\n\nAside from the required paperwork, I also took my work permits and DACA approval letters. I had misplaced two work permit cards but brought the approval letters, which were sufficient for my interview.\n\n**Day-by-Day Experience in Juárez:** \n\nThursday, 1/23 (Day 1): Drove from Arizona to Juárez and arrived at night. We stayed at City Express on Boulevard Tomás Fernández since it was cheaper and we had a car (only a 10-minute drive to the consulate). The area felt safe, and we tried many restaurants where everyone was extremely kind.\n\nFriday, 1/24 (Day 2): Doctor’s Appointment: 7 AM – Took 1 hour and 30 minutes. Everything was well-organized and quick. I did not need any vaccines since I got them all in the U.S. in advance (insurance covered them).\n\nBiometrics Appointment: 3 PM – Took about an hour. They only asked for my passport and DS-260 confirmation page. I forgot my DS-260 confirmation page, but I quickly printed it next door in under five minutes. I had to get back in line, but it was no hassle.\n\nSaturday & Sunday, 1/25-1/26 (Days 3 & 4): We explored the city, which was beautiful. We felt safe, and having a car was a huge plus.\n\nMonday & Tuesday, 1/27-1/28 (Days 5 & 6): Worked remotely from the hotel. Nothing fancy, but we went out to eat at nearby places and had a great time trying delicious foods.\n\nWednesday, 1/29 (Day 7)- 1st Consular Appointment (Paperwork Check): Appointment was at 7 AM (arrived at 6:15 AM). I waited about 20 minutes before going in. The process was smooth and took about 2 hours. It felt like a DMV visit, but instead of getting called by numbers, you move through a series of lines. They asked for my DS-260 confirmation page and the doctor’s appointment confirmation page. After that, they move you to a different section where they collected my DS-260 form, passport, and doctor’s confirmation page. They also requested: my husband’s and my birth certificates, marriage license, my passport, and my police certificate (which they confirmed I didn’t need). They clipped everything together along with a blue paper that had my appointment for the next day.\n\nThursday, 1/30 (Day 8) – 2nd Consular Appointment (Official Interview): Appointment was set for 7:30 AM – I arrived at the same time as the previous day. I waited longer in line, but once inside, everything went quickly. The interview sections are open, so you can hear others getting approved or denied—this made the atmosphere very nerve-wracking! My interview lasted under 5 minutes. I was asked: where I live, when did I crossed to the U.S., if it was my only time crossing, the meaning of my tattoos, and once she saw in the computer that I have DACA, she asked for all my DACA approvals. The officer approved my case and gave me a green paper, instructing me to wait for an email notification to pick up my passport.\n\nFriday, 1/31 (Day 9): Worked remotely from the hotel and paid for my green card. The green paper that had my approval had instructions to order my green card online, which cost $245 + taxes.\n\nSaturday, 2/1 (Day 10) – Passport Pickup: Received the email notification at 8am to pick up my passport. Went to the embassy (same place as biometrics), waited in line, and presented: Email confirmation number A form of ID They returned my passport with my temporary visa (valid for one year until I receive my green card).\n\nSunday, 2/2 (Day 11) – Returning to the U.S.: Paid $2.20 to cross back into the U.S. At the checkpoint, an officer took me into a room where people crossing on foot were processed. It had a lot of chairs, but since it was early, it was empty. I handed my passport to the officer at the window, who scanned it, stamped it, and sent me on my way—no questions asked.\n\n**Total spent for my process doing it myself: $1,575**\n\nI-130 Application Fee: $535 \n\nImmigrant Visa Fee: $325\n\nAffidavit of Support Fee: $120\n\nGreen Card fee: $245\n\nLawyer Fee: $350 (**ONLY** to submit I-130 application)\n\n\nThis was the most life-changing yet nerve-wracking experience of my life. I waited for this moment for almost my entire life, and the fear of being denied was overwhelming.\n\nBeing in Juárez, surrounded by thousands of people in the same situation, is an indescribable feeling. I hope this run-through gives you a glimpse of what the process is like out there.\n\nHappy to answer any questions!",

        "selftext": "This is a hypothetical situation. Or maybe its for a friend. Or maybe its for some other stranger on the internet. Or maybe I just like testing the sub's knowledge. I don't know shit about fuck. I prefer ice that melts.\n\nForgive the long post, but here we go:\n\nThe situation involves an elderly person well over 70 yrs old. This person has been in the United States since the 1950's. This person worked and paid taxes their whole lives. When this person applied for Social Security benefits some time ago, it was denied because of immigration status. The person's family was baffled. So the research and investigations began. Consider the following items about the person:\n\n\\- born in Mexico, has a Mexican birth certificate\n\n\\- born to an American citizen mother and Mexican father (no, this is not automatic, the law at the time required proof that the mom lived in the US for a certain amount of time, which she did)\n\n\\- came to the US as a young child\n\n\\- at some point in early adulthood, person filed for naturalization based on his mother's citizenship and US residence \n\n\\- person is now of older age and doesn't remember much from that time\n\n\\- person has a Social Security number issued from Texas in the 1950's\n\n\\- person has been married to an American citizen since the early 1980's\n\n\\- person worked legally (everyone assumes) for decades; even after eVerify became a thing, the person always qualified and was cleared as eligible for work until as recently as 2019\n\n\\- family tried to get info from USCIS, but none of the correspondence actually verifies his status, and they were only told that the prior Naturalization Application form was filled out incorrectly (no mention of eventual denial, acceptance, etc..)\n\n\\- family FOIA-ed a copy of the Naturalization Application, there are some administrative markings on it but nothing that says it was approved or denied\n\n\\- at the time of that application, the person did have an A- number. the person nor the family do not remember the person ever having a green card in recent years and always assumed they were a citizen\n\n\\- family tried to re-file Naturalization Application but it was not accepted (not denied, but kicked back) because the previous one was not filed out correctly\n\n\\- person has multiple other siblings that were in the same situation, some older and some younger, all born to same American mom and Mexican dad, and all of those siblings were naturalized long ago and are citizens\n\n\\- several lawyers have looked into this, and none have ultimately taken the case because of the complexity\n\nHERE'S THE KICKER: not too long ago, the person refiled for Social Security benefits, and was approved! They are getting their monthly check and are enrolled in Medicare. BUT, they can't cash the checks because they don't have a bank account in their name. The person only has an expired state driver's license, which expired around the same time as the discovery of this issue, so they have not been able to get a new ID with the new Real ID requirements.\n\nSo that's a partially happy ending with the SS benefits. But they need an ID and bank account, and the family is still not sure of the person's status. In order to get a Real ID, the DMV requires their Social Security benefits letter AND either their certificate of naturalization or other proof of citizenship.\n\nHERE'S THE ASK: How and where can the family safely verify status without raising any red flags? They are understandably nervous about the current climate, and they also don't want this to have been a mistake and have the benefits snatched back if they still can't prove eligibility.\n\nThe best case here is that the first time they filed, it was denied by mistake, and they have been a citizen all along. The fact that they have been working for forever, and that they always clear through eVerify, and that the SS benefits were eventually approved, probably means that AT LEAST they are a permanent resident (but again, no one remembers, has seen, or has ever had to use a green card for this person).\n\nAny ideas or resources you guys might have would be a world of help. Also referrals to a reputable lawyer that might be up for the challenge would also be amazing. Thanks in advance!\n\nTLDR: Older person doesn't know their status. It's a complex tale but all signs point to likely permanent residence or citizenship. Family needs help safely verifying without raising red flags.",

Just like every person of illegal immigrant status is being protrayed as a savage, violent rapist and murdered, those who are here legally are also being told that they will potentially be illegal pretty soon and removed. \n\nThoughts?",

But because of the hyphen, my Mexican birth certificate and other documents now treat “Diaz-Garcia” as a **single hyphenated last name**, instead of showing two separate last names (“Diaz” and “Garcia”).\n\nThis has created a problem getting my Mexican passport because it doesn’t reflect my real name. It also causes confusion since all my other US documents (except my birth certificate) have my correct name, “Leonardo Diaz Garcia,” without the hyphen.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this issue before? Is it possible to have my Mexican birth certificate corrected to reflect two separate last names (Diaz and Garcia) rather than one hyphenated name (Diaz-Garcia)?

        "selftext": "I was with an American girl for a good while in my life, we wanted to live together; however, we're from different countries and she has a kid so I ended up agreeing to be the one who moves for the other, as much as I would have preferred to carry on living in Europe; however, it was something I was willing to sacrifice for the woman I loved. During this time, I found myself having a headache trying to navigate confusing resources regarding how we should go about the process of closing the distance between each other. I am making this post to explain some things I've learned to somebody who may be in the same boat I was, a long time ago. We have broken up since and I'm much happier with her out of my life but I have learned valuable information and I wish that a pair of lovers out there can make better use of it than me and my ex were able to.      \n\nMy ex wanted us to get married when I was visiting her in the USA; however, I refused. (dodged a bullet of a lifetime)     \n\nI refused to marry who I thought to be the love of my life, because, as far as I was aware, marrying an American on American soil as an alien requires a K1 Visa; which at the time, we were not able to back financially due to her not meeting the income requirements of being a sponsor. I believed that if I were to visit her and marry her on her whim, I would be committing visa fraud, which carries a long prison penalty and can lead to permanent deportation from the USA. Needless to say, I was wrong.      \n\nI entered the USA on my ESTA, which actually allows you to marry in the United States; however, it is only permissible under the condition that you do not intend to remain in the USA afterwards and will leave within the time period the ESTA allows you to stay for. Later on, marrying in this way may allow your partner to file for you as an immigrant spouse, allowing you two to apply for a CR1 or IR1 green card, assuming your partner is able to sponsor you.     \n\nMy ex was a single mother and unemployed for a majority of the relationship. While it seems reasonable for a single person to be somewhat comfortably able to sponsor a spouse on an average income, the income requirements increase depending on how many dependents the sponsor has. My ex being a single mother made it quite difficult for her to reasonably reach this income level, especially when the job she eventually did find, she'd have to take days off quite often because she had difficulty with securing childcare and the father was absent and wasn't even on the birth certificate and there was no child support settlement so whatever scraps he'd occasionally throw her on cashapp when she came begging wouldn't really count towards her taxed income, making it a non-factor to USCIS.      \n\nWith this in mind, we had to look for a joint sponsor. A joint sponsor can be anybody who is willing to take on the burden of being a sponsor who has the means of sponsoring your spouse. Her mother made just enough to have been able to back the sponsorship; however, another option I had discovered was the ability to have two joint sponsors at once; however, struggled to find much more information on the intricacies of this option. Some resources said that if you are to be sponsored by two people, it must be a pair with joined income, such as a married couple; however, I am unsure to what extent this is true, as information on dual sponsors is difficult to come by online and the resources I did find weren't very specific on how it works. Sponsors may also be able to wager their property, if adequately high in value, to make up for any income requirement shortcomings.    \n\nAdditionally, I would like to go over the bona fide relationship proof process, as I rarely see it being spoken about at its true length. Me and my ex had a genuine relationship, I loved her, I loved her daughter to death, and I loved her family. Having trouble proving your that relationship is genuine will typically not come as much of a problem to real couples, assuming you remain conscious of the process and take the necessary steps together throughout your time together to make sure that nobody can poke holes in your relationship and doubt it. Remember to take many photos together, especially if you are in a long distance relationship like I was. Make sure to save everything that links the two of you together. Save gifts, save letters, save flight tickets, everything you can get your hands on that shows that you two share a past together. You really don't need to overkill it, just show that you two love each other and that this is something serious that has been going on for a fairly long period of time. Forget about hauling ass across the world for a girl you met on discord three days ago, is what I'm trying to get at here.     \n\nYou will need to prove your relationship is bona fide, when applying for a K1 visa, or a CR1/IR1 green card. You do not need to prove your relationship is bona fide, when you enter the USA to marry on an ESTA; however, as far as I am aware, if you disclose this while entering the USA at border control you will be subject to significantly more scrutiny and will likely be dragged to secondary inspection. When I would visit the USA I'd just disclose at the border that I am visiting my girlfriend for the week and despite showing the return flight and asserting I have a life back home I can't just abandon on a whim, without fail, the lovely border officers made sure my ex waits a couple more hours at the airport. I never had an issues at secondary control, though, I'd just show them everything, including our texts planning our week together, and I was let through without a hassle.     \n\nI'd imagine that if you can reasonably prove you are going to return home after marrying on an ESTA you should be fine as well; however, if you've already flown there and spend hundreds if not thousands for the flight, just be low-key and tell them you're visiting your partner. You can just haul ass back home afterwards with a ring on your finger. You can also claim you were proposed to while there and married with no prior intentions in the heat of the moment. Marrying in the USA is pretty easy you can have a civil ceremony for like a hundred bucks but I'm unsure if this varies per state, please do your research based on where you plan to elope exactly. We would have had it pretty easy since it was Montgomery County, Maryland.      \n\nA batshit crazy idea we had at the height of the relationship when we weren't think rationally as madly in-love 20 year olds was her getting pregnant with my child which would make it so she could put me in a situation where I'd have to marry her and the government couldn't take issue with it, effectively allowing us to get quite far ahead at the cost of us having a baby at a point in a relationship where we had no business starting a family and also taking a gigantic risk if she were to be pregnant and I were to be forced to leave the USA. Please never go this route unless you are absolutely desperate or have the means together to raise a child and be sponsored by your spouse. We did not and if we went with this route we'd be ultra fucked because she'd then need to make even more money to be a potential sponsor.      \n\nAll that aside, once you do actually marry, in whichever (documented) way you've managed to, you are now legally their spouse and eligible to potentially be petitioned for a CR1 or IR1 green card. A CR1 (CR = Conditional Relative) is given to a spouse who has been married less than two years and vice versa. CR1 lasts for two years before you need to file an I-175 which, if approved, changes you from a \"conditional relative\" to an \"immediate relative\" (Hence the \"IR\"). While doing this, you will, once again, need to prove that you and your spouse are in a bona fide relationship but this time you should come fully stacked with everything you can to prove you two have a life together. Joint bills, joint bank account statements, proof of living together, pictures together, and the most effective evidence, birth certificates of any children you may have had together while living together in the USA. Once you are converted from CR1 to IR1 you have a green card which is valid for 10 years before needing to be renewed. This gives you more than enough time to become a naturalized citizen of the United States of America and finally be able to relax and not have to fear getting fucked over by USCIS. All the best.      \n\nI also apologise for any typos, I'm writing this on a late night, unable to sleep and wanted to share my findings to tire myself out mentally",

After spending 45 days in Mexico, my total time in the U.S. and neighboring countries will add up to around 130 days.\n\nHowever, it’s significantly cheaper for me to fly back to my home country (Australia) by exiting through the U.S. My concern is whether I could face issues at the border when re-entering the U.S., given that my \"total time\" in the U.S. and nearby regions exceeds 90 days.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? Could this impact my eligibility for a travel visa or re-entry? Any guidance would be appreciated.\n\nMy thought is that as i am not looking for a Visa waiver and just want to transit, the border patrol may allow it as it's not time in the USA, although i understand it could be different in practice.",

I don't remember which specific years I went overseas and which I didn't. Neither do my parents. \n\nSince the form asks for \"precise periods of time in the United States\" as opposed to estimates, I am a bit uncomfortable with swearing that everything is correct, given the uncertainty around the exact dates I was in the USs.

        "selftext": "Am not looking for advice, so much as commiseration.\n\nMy wife is American, and I'm not. We live outside the US. We have 3 kids. I registered the first 2 kids' births at the consulate (CRBA), and subsequently got their passports. Kid 3 was born during Covid, so I did it in the opposite order; we got his passport without the CRBA. Now, I am finally getting the paperwork together to apply for his report of birth abroad. I know, this is not technically needed given that he already has his US passport, but there are certain bureaucratic contexts in which I have found it useful to have the CRBA in addition to the passports for the other kids.\n\nThe [state.gov](http://state.gov) website, the passport application process, and the consular staff have frequently disagreed with each other about the requirement re US presence. They frequently use \"presence\" and \"residence\" interchangeably. Given this, when I applied for kiddo #1, I prepared two versions of the form in advance of our visit. The first listed the periods my wife lived in the US (easy: a single period right up to the time I whisked her away in her 20's). The second listed the periods my wife was physically present in the US. This second form was painful to assemble, because she was on a team that represented the US at international competitions from the time she was an early teen. She travelled internationally ALL THE TIME. Plus, we travel to the US frequently for business. That form had more than 30 \"periods of presence\" in the US. I used her passport stamps and the results of a freedom of information request to DHS to get her travel history as best I could.\n\nI showed both forms to the consular staff, and asked them which one they wanted. The fellow laughed at me, and took the shorter form.\n\nFor kid #2, I brought only the shorter form.\n\nWhen applying for passport for kind #3, I sent only the shorter form. They sent a follow-up requesting more information, which again conflated residence and presence, and we pointed this out via a letter, and they eventually issued the passport. No problem.\n\nNow I'm finally getting around to applying for CRBA for kid #3. Now, they have a fancy web interface. Now, THAT form does NOT conflate presence and residence. In fact, they explicitly give an example of a person taking a brief trip ending one period of presence, and beginning another.\n\nKid #1 is 7 years older than kid #3, so I now have to assemble another 7 years worth of travel history. I'd bet there will be another 20 or 30 trips to the US, some as short as a couple of hours, e.g. to apply for kid #3's passport (had to do this at a post office). One trip literally lasted only 30 minutes to do a Nexus interview. Obviously we don't count the times spent in the water over the border without landing, or in US airspace with origin and destination airports outside the US. But this is all so dumb.\n\nThis web form is PAINFUL. You can't type the dates, you have to click around in a horrible UI. You can't type the name of a state like a normal drop-down box.\n\nI'm told there's now a web portal where I can get her travel history from DHS, so at least I may not have to file another FOA request.\n\nI yell to the universe: the US law requires only a certain minimal amount of time in the US at particular life periods in order for kid #3 to qualify for US citizenship. Her period of physical presence #1 covers that requirement. Every piece of data entry, which will likely take a whole day, is not actually needed to satisfy this law. But, the form (but not the law) requires every period of presence up to the birth of the kiddo. So none of this data entry is actually necessary.\n\nNo doubt others on this forum have far more painful experiences. and this may land poorly. But on the off chance this can be a source of commiseration, thank you in advance for your warm wishes :)",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\n I have been thinking about how each region and locality of the US could be allowed to select (with flexible requirements and own rules for rejecting/accepting) and get more people to work and live as they need. Of course, this is given only when decision on its acceptance is given by the federal government. Also, depending on each program's rules, nominees could be able to bring their spouses and single children under 21 without any derivative dependents (if not, probably some nonimmigrant visas should be made widely available not for just the proposed pathway nominees, but for all LPR in general).\n\n So, my proposal would allocate 500-1000 nominees each year (maybe same flat limit for each state or varying per state population) to each US state, so that they can run their programs and fill in some crucial vacancies as needed. The unused part would not propagate further to any immigration path. Each state would be running an official website with all the info and terms.\n\n Next, each county and county-equivalent, as well as each Native American reservation would be getting 30-100 (allocation options as for states) slots each year for selecting and putting immigrants how and where they want. Additionally, states or feds (for reservations) could add some limited number of add-on allocation numbers for discretion of these 2nd level administrative units. Plus, they could simplify finding info about them by adding it to the state's website they are located in. Reservations could be all demonstrating their programs in another website. As an optional feature, in case approved by USCIS and DOL, when applicable, the localities could transfer their limits to one another, but none of them could get transferred more than their original limit.\n\n The character of each nomination could be contractual, with possible terms of first living in the specified place/area and working in a certain occupation or field for up to 5 years, separate terms of renewability of nonimmigrant \"bridge\" visas, although eventually every nomination would need to be allowing LPR if no serious deviations are seen. Further, to accommodate dependent family members in case needed, exceeding the limit by up to 10% for county, county-equivalent, and reservation programs each year could be allowed with the withdrawal of that number from either own local nomination limit or state limit, as agreed by respective authorities.\n\n Further, given meeting some federal standards for entry clearance, the state or local government-appointed personnel would approve or reject case-by-case every application (say, a video-call or in some cases even some live meeting with some representation-authorized persons outside US could be allowed). That approval then becomes the basis for going to the consulate/embassy to get nonimmigrant \"bridge\" visas or immigrant new arrival visas; and similarly in USCIS offices in the US. I think the administrative units must be free to limit eligibility by country of birth/citizenship, but never by religion (of course excluding radical beliefs), race, or ethnicity. Some more details would need to be determined as well, of course.\n\n In summary, this outline would have these programs invite up to 25-50 thousand people annually for states, and 104,040-348600 for 2nd level administrative units; a cumulative total is 154,040-398,600. I am pretty sure that if enacted, these limits would not be used by even 80% that often. Some measure of staged introduction (lower limits in the first few years) could be used as well. Also, required are specific universal, but not too hefty regulations for employers and organizations that co-operate with these state and local immigration programs.\n\n Please, consider writing your opinion about this. I think the higher-end limit is too much, if utilized close to full capacity.\n\n  \n TL;DR: I have an outline of a would-be immigration system that would, with a cumulative annual limit of 154 to about 400 thousand people yearly, allow US states, counties, county-equivalents, and Native American reservations nominate people for immigration.",

I don't know Reddit but I'm not getting answers anywhere else.\n\nMy parents are from Mexico but I believe got amnesty in the 80s though I'm fuzzy on the details. Regardless, they absolutely are naturalized and they told me and my four siblings that we were all born here in Texas and are 100% American citizens. I personally have never had any issues and my siblings, minus the brother in question, have said the same. We have gotten copies of our birth certificates, social security cards, gotten drivers licenses and passports with no issue other than the usual annoyances of those processes. We've had jobs without issue.\n\nSo, anyway, my oldest brother has gotten into some bad trouble over theft and burglaries and apparently there's an immigration attorney involved.\n\nI asked my parents about it and they said it was just a mistake, that he was racially profiled but I looked up his court documents and it comes up a lot. \n\nIt says WORK_WITH_IMMIGRA_ATTY on many of these documents and I'm thinking it's not a mistake if it's multiple times on multiple dates. And that's what I'm asking for clarification on.\n\nIs it at all possible that it was a mistake? Could there be any reason an immigration attorney would consult with a citizen? If not, does this necessarily mean he's undocumented? He was born in 1985 and it is my understanding that children at the time were also naturalized but could there be some issue there?\n\nI'm sorry if I sound naive, ignorant, or desperate. Up until this point, I honestly had no reason to be knowledgeable about immigration. My family is heavily Americanized. We never spoke Spanish in the house (I don't know it at all!) and my parents unfortunately have an \"above it all\" mentality about our Mexican heritage, which always made me somewhat uncomfortable but that's another story for another day.\n\nI can't understand why he would have that on there if he is a citizen. I don't know why he wouldn't be a citizen in the first place or why he didn't become one by now if he wasn't.\n\nIt doesn't make sense and my parents are very tight-lipped about it. They have boxed us out completely on the subject and I apparently can't contact my brother in jail because I'm not on his list.\n\nI just know they're more worried than I've ever seen them in my life. My mom barely eats and just stays in bed all the time. My dad retired in 2019 but started working again because of the legal expenses. Maybe it's just the 5-10 years he's likely facing in prison but given everything else, I have this gut feeling that it's a lot more than that.  They're both so tired and I fear this will kill them, honestly, but they're boxing everyone out and won't let us help. Or maybe we can't do anything.\n\nThis has been a very troubling experience and I need to do something about this impending feeling of doom I have. \n\nAny help on this is appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Good Afternoon, r/immigration, \n\nBasically, the title summarizes it pretty well. I am 22 years old, having been born and raised in Germany to an American father and German mother. I am fairly certain I did not automatically obtain citizenship at birth due to my dad not meeting the residency requirements (5 years in total LIVING in the US, with two of the years being completed after the 14th birthday). He never filed a CRBA, or form N600K. Still, he is a US citizen, having and having kept ONLY the US Citizenship (despite living in Germany for close to 50 years).\n\nMy Grandfather, however, would very much be meeting the requirements (He lived in the USA for about 40 years before my Dad was born, and about 5 years just after), and as stated in the Instructions for form N600K, this would also count, given I can prove my Dads dependency on my Grandpa (which I also can). The problem here is that I am now over 18 years of age, which means form N600K doesn't apply to me anymore. Another important factor would be that my grandpa was in the Air Force for a pretty long time, with this also being the reason for him moving to Germany 5 years after adopting my Dad. We have multiple files documenting his service and exceptional performance during these years, on North American AND \"foreign\" US soil (\"Foreign\" as in the barracks here in Germany).\n\nI am currently residing in Germany, but I'm very much planning on moving to the US sooner than later. I believe I do have everything it should take to be granted citizenship / prove I am eligible for citizenship, my only REAL issue is the fact that theres no Form to fill out as I am, as stated before, resident in Germany, over the Age of 18 and have never lived in the USA myself.\n\nMy question now is the following: What are my options? How, where, and to whom can I prove my eligibility for citizenship based on the factors I just listed? Are there any forms I can fill out (except for N-600, N-600K, and DS-2029, as I don't meet the eligibility requirements for these)? Are there any resources for cases as mine? Sadly, the two USCIS agents I talked to weren't of much help, which is why I am asking here. If you made it this far, I appreciate you taking time to read through this, and if you have any answers/tips/ideas where to start, I'd greatly appreciate you telling me either through the comments or PMs. If you need any more information to be able to help me, please let me know as well.\n\nThank you very much and have a great rest of your day, \n\nJake",

I’m planning to submit the I-129F paperwork soon, but I recently watched a live stream from an Iranian immigration lawyer who advised against applying for a K1 Visa for Iranian citizens. He recommended scheduling a consultation with an immigration lawyer instead.\n\nI’ve been reading that K1 Visa processing times have improved recently, with some cases being approved in under 8 months. However, I'm concerned about potential political changes that might complicate things, such as the possibility of a travel ban being reinstated for Iranians.Additionally, I’m considering the best country for my fiancée to attend her K1 visa interview. Should we look at Ankara, Abu Dhabi, or another location given the current timelines and processing speeds?\n\nAnother option I’m contemplating is sending my fiancée to Mexico or Canada for college while waiting for the K1 Visa. Would this make the process easier or faster in any way, or could it complicate things? I’d really appreciate any advice, personal anecdotes, or guidance you can offer on navigating this process. If you’ve been through something similar, how did you manage, and what would you suggest?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!!!",

My mother is Canadian and my dad has dual citizenship (Canadian and American), in which I know that he has had American citizenship since birth. I have recently been looking into how likely I would be to acquire dual citizenship through transmission, and I feel like I have a claim at citizenship due to my father being listed on my birth certificate. I believe he does have the physical presence requirements as well, as far as I know he was born and raised in the U.S until he was at least 16-18 which is before I was born.\n\nMy main question is, since my father is basically estranged and we have little to no relationship, do I need to get in contact with him to sign the affidavit of parentage and obtain evidence that he is a u.s citizen as well as evidence of physical presence? Also, would my birth certificate with his name on it count as evidence of parentage/legitimation, and child support payments as proof of financial support?\n\n  \nAlso, how would I check if I have been a u.s citizen since birth, would I have been given a CRBA if this is the case? My dad lived in the U.S for at least 5 years before I was born, so I think I should have qualified for that as well but i'm not too sure on the process of finding out.\n\n  \nThank you!",

Now, because of her success, her company wants to transfer her to the US on an L1 visa. The I-129 looks set to be approved in the coming weeks.\n\nNow, to get the twins to the US they face a few issues.\n\n1. Proving biological relationship: Birth certificate has Andy's name. But the closest blood relatives of Andy who are living are Andy's mother (grandmother) and Andy's full brother (uncle). I am not sure if DNA can prove the biological relationship to 99.99 the US consulate may require.\n\n2. Legitimation/acknowledgment of paternity/court adjudication of paternity: The twins would only be legitimated if the parents married. Andy did not acknowledge paternity. He \"declared\" it. Thus, he is on the birth certificate. He did it in the government office where people usually do this. However, we are not sure whether it was \"under oath.\" There is no \"subscribed and sworn to\" in the acknowledgment, but it is signed and stamped by the foreign governmental authority. I should note that the US embassy in the country actually requests this statement when doing CRBA. The other twist is, he did this before the twins were born. As far as court adjudication of paternity, there were no court proceedings for the sole purposes of establishing paternity. Rather, it was in probate, that the foreign court just assumed Andy is the father of the twins because his name was on the birth certificate.\n\nGiven the fact that it is not clear-cut if the children were legitimated and whether the acknowledgment was done properly to get citizenship by US law, is it better if they just straight apply for L2 visa and not waste $100 for the CRBA?",

They tell us if we have urgent travel back to the US, we need to send them an email.  There are few problems with this:\n\n1. We don't have urgent travel back to the US, but back to country A because of job reasons. We **both** need to be back in country A by end of August. Her job starts at end of August and my paternity leave ends.\n\n2. For the urgent travel request, they expect us to send them a booked travel itinerary. This is odd considering that when foreign nationals apply for visas, the DoS says not to buy any tickets till you have the visa. I would expect similar logic to apply to passports. A passport is even more fundamental to travel than a visa because you can fly many places without a visa depending on which country's citizenship you hold. Why would you buy tickets without a passport?\n\n3. Problem 2 isn't so much of a problem right now because our baby can use country B's passport to travel to country A and get a residence permit in country A. However, we both have work trips to New York to meet clients beginning of September. She has a B1/B2 visa which is fine to use because she is just meeting clients. But we are not sure if we can get a US passport in time for our baby to enter the US by September.\n\nNow, applying for a CRBA from country A will take even more processing time because kid was born in country B so I am not sure CRBA and passport will be finished by September.\n\nIn this situation, looking at our options it seems they are:\n\n1. Get a B1/B2 visa in country A for the baby using visa interview waiver program since the applicant is a minor and a parent holds a B1/B2 visa (aka my gf). Those seem to be faster than CRBA and passport because appointments are within like 14 calendar days. \n\n2. I fly to Mexico with our baby (passport from country B allows visa free travel there). GF flies and enters on B1/B2. My gf, me, and baby show up at the land border to make sure CBP doesn't think I am abducting baby and so they can do a DNA test if they don't believe the birth certificate and we figure it out there.\n\nSo how can I get our baby a US passport before September?",

        "selftext": "**EDIT: We just used the Visa Status Check page (which I didn't know about until today), which says that the BCC was approved last Wednesday (July 17, 2024). However, my wife still has not received any email, let alone a DHL tracking number. Is this normal? If we don't have a tracking number by this Wednesday, we're going to write to the relevant email (since the page says to follow up if no number has been sent after 5 business days).**\n\nHi all!\n\nI'm seeking some insights about the current processing times for a Border Crossing Card (BCC) renewal. Here’s the situation:\n\nI'm a U.S. citizen residing in Mexico, and my wife, who is Mexican, recently had her BCC renewal appointment. It took place on June 26, 2024, in Mexico City, and so far, we haven't received any updates.\n\nI understand that the typical processing time is around 8 to 12 weeks, so under normal circumstances, I wouldn't be too concerned about the lack of news at this stage. However, something has made me wonder about the lack of follow-up so far.\n\n**Comparison to My Half-Brother's Experience:**\n\nMy half-brother and his family, all Mexican citizens without dual citizenship, had their BCC appointment in April of this year. Despite several previous denials, they were approved within a week of their appointment. During their interview, they were informed of their approval on the spot.\n\nNotably, my father, who is also my half-brother's father, had requested assistance from our Senator (Patty Murray, of Washington state), asking for special consideration to help my half-brother and his family get approved in light of their previous denials. I would suspect this intervention played a role in their swift approval process.\n\n**Factors I'm Considering:**\n\n1. **Application Timing:**\n   * My half-brother and his family submitted their application over a year ago, potentially allowing consular officials more time to pre-review their documentation.\n   * In contrast, my wife received her renewal appointment just one month after submitting her application, which might not have provided enough time for a thorough review.\n2. **Senatorial Intervention:**\n   * My half-brother's case had the added benefit of the senatorial support mentioned above, which we did not seek for my wife's application. Could this have expedited their process?\n3. **Renewal vs. First-Time Applications:**\n   * Does anyone know if renewals typically take longer than first-time applications? Could the shorter interval between application submission and the appointment for renewals be a factor in longer processing times?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven that my wife previously held a 10-year BCC with a spotless record, which expired in November 2023, I'm curious if the lack of news on her renewal is within the norm or if there might be other factors at play.\n\nAny insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help!",

Some of you numbskulls think you know better but haven't even read my post and began to comment things you didn't understand when you failed to read my post.  We have turned in all evidence prior to the interview. At the interview, the interviewer had all the information that we provided beforehand, therefore only asked to see her green card.  I'm sure you all had a hard time with your process because you couldn't read a 3 paragraph post without misinterpreting it.  To those that did read my post and gave me good advice: thank you.  The notice to appear was generic, and did not pertain to my case. I made sure that all required documents were submitted 3 months prior to the interview.  Nothing was needed, just pass the civics and English test, which took her all of 3 minutes of the interview and she was approved for citizenship.\n\n\n\nWe were married in Mexico back in February of 2013, and she emigrated to the US in 2015. We don't know what happened to the original marriage certificate. We had it when we applied for her green card and for the citizenship, but somehow it got lost.  All we have is a copy that has a translation overlay over it, so the words are in English.  It also came with its certification of translation.\n\nWe filled out the N-400 online and turned in all the required documents with the application online, so they should have access to the copies.  The interview was vague on what to bring other than her green card, and information online is very unreliable.  I turned in our tax info, our rental agreement, to show that she is paying taxes and that we live together. Everything that the N-400 asked, we provided it.  Why is the interview asking to bring this information with us? It seems like generic information. I will be going with her and providing my birth certificate and passport and Federal government ID card, in case they ask me to step inside and to swear testimony and ask relationship questions.  I am so anxious and worrying about everything.\n\nAm I missing something?  She smashed the 100 civics questions (2008) that I tested her on, and her English is good enough.  She isn't a terrorist, an insane anarchist-activist, or a criminal.  She has lived in the US for 9 years, never committed a crime, doesn't have anti-American views, attends church, pays taxes, and is a good citizen.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nMy girlfriend lives in a country where divorcing a spouse takes a long time. It requires a lengthy separation if there is no mutual consent. In the middle we moved in with each other and she had our child.\n\nWe are in the middle of legal proceedings to establish that I am the father and a DNA test has been taken. However, it will be some more time until a final order of paternity is done and I am declared the legal father, after which there will be a custody order.\n\nGiven all this, I am not sure if my child is eligible for US citizenship. When my child was born, his legal parents were my girlfriend and her soon-to-be-ex-husband. So the child is considered as born in-wedlock. Then we go to INA 301 which determines US citizenship for those born in-wedlock and it says that one of the parents must be a US citizen, which of course makes sense. When I looked at the decisions of *Scales v INS* it says\n\n> The INA does expressly require a blood relationship between a person claiming citizenship and a citizen father, if the person is born out of wedlock.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1409(a)(1) (setting forth legitimation requirements for a person born out of wedlock to a citizen father).   This provision does not apply to Petitioner, however, because he was born to parents who were married at the time of his birth.\n\nSo does this mean that since my child **at birth** had two legal parents who were married to each other, INA 309 cannot be applied to my child and that only INA 301 applies? In which case, my child does not get citizenship because INA 301 requires at least one parent to be a US citizen, and neither of the legal parents at birth were US citizens? INA 301 applies to legitimate children and my child is legitimate as he was born when his legal parents **at birth** were married to each other. The only thing is, one of his legal parents was not the actual biological father.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone \n\nMy wife and I are recent US citizens. We have parents living outside the US that are foreign citizens.\n\nWe are considering doing the petition to get a green card for our parents and I have a few questions:\n\n1. [Various sources seem to state that ](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-long-does-family-based-immigration-to-the-us-take/#:~:text=The%20median%20processing%20time%20for,months%20between%202013%20and%202023.&text=Home%20%2F%20Population%20and%20society%20%2F%20Articles,immigration%20to%20the%20US%20take%3F)it takes much shorter to get a parent a green card than e.g. siblings - for example around 1-2 years - is this correct? \n\n2. Our parents are currently not considering moving to the US but we were thinking we should get the process of the green card going in any case given the length of time it could take to process. Once they get the green card would it just be possible then for them to come into the US every now and then (e.g. once or twice a year) to \"keep the green card active\" without having to apply for a re-entry permit and can we do that indefinitely until they are ready to settle here permanently? Which may be several years down the line \n\n3. My wife's mother is remarried - does that mean that only her mother (who is her mother by birth) can apply for the green card but not her husband (we consider him like a father - but he is not her birth father) ? Does he need to apply separately through her as a spouse? I wouldn't want to split them up for any long period of time obviously \n\n4. Once they have the green card and reside here permanently. Can they eventually also become US citizens? For us it was just over 5 years from receiving our green card to citizenship. Would it be the same for them ?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

The regulations don't say they need the permission of some third person. They say \"both parents.\" I'm already a parent as recognized by the fact that the CRBA contains my name. You can't have one meaning of parent and father for the CRBA and another for the passport consent.\n\nWhat sort of bullshit is this?

Now, he (a year and a half old) receives therapy, which is extremely taxing for my husband and me. I suffer from Lupus and am in constant pain due to flares.\n\nI am originally from Peru. My family had to leave the country because we were not safe, especially after an earthquake destroyed a city, making life difficult for my parents. We had to leave to preserve our lives.\n\nMy husband is from Mexico and also had to escape due to drug cartels. Since he lived near the border with a permit, the cartels threatened him to become a drug mule or die. This forced him to flee the country. He has been in the U.S. for more than ten years now.\n\nIt has been more than five years since I came to the U.S. I met my husband here, and that’s how we had our baby. We are a family. Is there a chance of applying for asylum? Will the fact that my child needs special attention and that I need to be with him somehow help our case?\n\nI contacted an attorney for an asylum consultation, and they quoted me $500 just for him to hear my case. I’m not sure if this is worthwhile or if we even have a possibility of success. We are afraid of trying and then having to go back, as not only our lives are in danger, but also my baby’s.\n\nThank you",

We are not sure what name to use for the plane ticket so she doesn’t have a problem getting through security in Mexico.

Her Mexican passport has it as Deborah Sofia Gomez Flores, with Flores being her mom’s maiden name, and García being in a separate section under surname of spouse. When she applied for her Mexican passport she was told they don’t attach surnames for women, like “de García”, anymore and just use the name given at birth.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'll start off by saying I am getting a lawyer due to the complexity of the case but I'm looking for advice / questions to ask on how to address an immigration case involving my parents, both natives of Mexico with a long history in the U.S., but facing challenges due to past legal issues and misinformation. \n\nHere’s a brief overview:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Clients:** My parents, who have two adult children who are U.S. citizens (ages 21 and 30).\n* **History:** They arrived in the U.S. in November 1989. They were involved in removal proceedings in 2004 due to unauthorized presence and represented themselves after being misled by notario fraud.\n* **Current Status:** The judge in 2004 ordered voluntary departure for my mother and removal for my father (who had a prior removal and returned following an expedited removal order). The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed these decisions.\n* **Additional Info:** \n   * They have been in the U.S. continuously since their respective arrivals (my mother since 1989, my father since 1999 after a brief departure 10 days in which he received the Expedited Removal Order). \n   * [The California Bar had taken possession of their files from the notario as part of a fraud case and was returned to them in 2018.](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/state-bar-helps-clients-of-bogus-immigration-law-practice#:~:text=On%20April%2010%2C%20Bonilla%20pleaded,to%20additional%20fines%20and%20penalties) I barely came across the letter from the Bar and seek help. They had at the time of the letter gone to a lawyer who told them to wait as Immigration Reform was possible soon (lol) where my father would not have to serve the bar..\n      *  [Since then USCIS has mentioned bars may be served in the United Stated. ](https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/USCIS%20%26%20BIA%20Affirm%20Three-%20and%20Ten-Year%20Unlawful%20Presence%20Bars%20Can%20Run%20in%20the%20US.pdf)\n\n**Desired Outcome:**\n\nWe wish to explore all possible legal avenues to allow either them to remain in the U.S. legally and adjust their status, potentially under I-130 petitions, as both qualify for immediate visas with U.S. citizen children over 21.\n\n**Main Questions:**\n\n1. **Reopening the Case:** What are the prospects and procedures for potentially reopening my father's case based on ineffective counsel due to notario fraud? What evidence would be required?\n2. **Waivers and Legal Barriers:** What specific waivers (e.g., I-601A, I-212, Form I-485) are necessary for each parent, considering their past immigration history and current status?\n3. **Legal Strategies:** Are there particular legal considerations or strategies that would be effective in navigating their complex situation, especially given the permanent bar and voluntary departure issues? \n\nAny insights, advice, or recommendations for legal resources and immigration experts who specialize in similar cases would be deeply appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",

Just sent it in today so hopefully hear a response within the next months! Super excited for the next steps. \n\n\n\nI've been looking all over youtube, and have went to my local Mexican consulate. I am trying to obtain my Mexican citizenship through my mother. She was born in Mexico and has a Mexican Birth Certificate. However, when she immigrated over here, she left out her first name on documents and used her middle name as her first name. Because of this her name on my \"Mother\" section of my US birth certificate is different from the name on her Mexican Birth Certificate and the consulate told me that I needed to fix that.\n\nI am from California, so I reached out to DNE however I know that will be expensive. If anyone has any  advice/ next steps I would greatly appreciate it. Worst case scenario, my mother will have to change her name, however, I'm worried about the repercussions that come with that.\n\nThank you!",

As I did more research I realized I wanted to work specifically on the US/Mexico border as it is currently a major issue there. The problem is that I have an undocumented parent and was wondering if you guys know if this would completely stop my chance of getting a job in Homeland Security. I am trying to fix papers for her but because there was a mistake on my birth certificate that has to get fixed first.  Thanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "I (27M US citizen) met my wife (27F Mexican Citizen) in Texas while she was there ilegally. She entered legally with a tourist visa and a 6 month permit and she had been there 3 years by the time we met in 2017. After dating and living together over a year, we got engaged. After meeting with an immigration lawyer and getting bad advice, we got on a plane and traveled out of the US to her home country of Mexico. We planned to travel together to the US/Mexico border crossing at Laredo Tx with a K1 visa in order to enter legally, get married and live the rest of our life together. However, due to a break in at our apartment back home, I had to fly back to Texas while my fiancé drove up with a family member. When she arrived at the border, my fiancé was asked about the flight she took out of the US two weeks prior and was of course given a 5 year ban from entering the US. \n\n5 years later, we've been married about 5 years, have a 3 year old son born in Mexico, and another child on the way. My only real question is, after serving her deportation and being married the whole time to an american citizen, can she apply for her Green Card without the help of a lawyer? Can I fill out the I-130 form and the 601 waiver and handle all of that on my own and save the almost $10k every lawyer wants to charge to to just file the paperwork. I have spoken to multiple lawyers and they all pretty much admit that they cannot do anything to expedite the process and wont be present to represent her in any interview. Why should we pay the lawyer instead of doing it all myself like when I filled out the eCRBA for my son?\n\n​\n\nTL;DR: Can I apply for my wife's Green Card without the help of a lawyer after she has served a 5 year deportation?

        "selftext": "Ok, so this is a bit of a unique situation, because my son was born in the foreign country where I live, via donor and isn’t genetically related to me, and the country where I live doesn’t recognize my marriage. However, turns out I was able to pass my US citizenship on to him in the end, so that leads me to this question:\n\nI entered the U.S. last year with my son (he was two months old) and he had a foreign passport and an ESTA. My partner (wife as recognized in US) who gave birth to him also accompanied me and she came in with the same situation, foreign passport and ETSA for herself. At the time I remember wondering if my son would actually qualify to be a U.S. Citizen, but hadn’t completely thought it through.  I guess I had doubts because the country I live in doesn’t recognize him as my son; they view my partner as a single parent. My partner is a nonresident alien to the US. \n\nAnyhow, since then, and after checking with the US embassy, etc. that it was OK even though I’m not a bio parent, I realized I could get a CRBA for my son and an American Passport. I have done so and he currently holds a US Passport now. \n\nI know that US Citizens by birth are required to use a US Passport when entering the US, and I plan to do it from here on out. We actually have plans to visit the US soon.  \n\nIs there going to be an issue that he entered with an ESTA last time? The ESTA is actually still valid currently. \n\nI also believe that the law that allows me to transfer citizenship to my son (in the case of not being the bio parent) - apparently this law is also fairly new and people weren’t able to do it in the past. It honestly wasn’t something I expected at first (sadly, I’m quite used to the lack of recognition in my current country of residence. I also have a son who I gave birth to myself and he was not given citizenship of the country where he was born…so I guess I was a little pessimistic about it at first). \n\nIf any immigration officer asks me about it going through, I plan to simply answer honestly. \n\nIf anyone has any insight on this I’d appreciate info or advice.  \n",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account for anonymity Sorry for the long post, but I feel most of the info is relevant, and it’s been a long journey, and it’s not over yet  \nMe (Us Citizen) any my now wife (Mexican citizen) are living in Mexico City but want to move to the US in a couple years. Here’s the situation. We met through a friend almost 6 years ago. Dated for awhile, She had got her B1/B2 visa and every few months we would fly to visit. Sometimes she would come her, sometimes I would go there. We decided to go for the k-1 fiancé and K-2 visa for her daughter (19 at the time) things were taking time as was expected, and everything went through and even got to the interview at the embassy. This is where it all fell apart. 20-ish years prior, she was in the US illegally. This was known and well established knowledge. The US knew it from the B1/B2 (we learn the 10 year forgiveness rule) the lawyer knew it. But, she also had brought her then 6 month old daughter with her. we had told the lawyer, but nothing came of it. We thought we were clear and this was just another stepping stone. The interviewer learned of the daughter’s situation, and it was determined that this was helping another human into the USA, and didn’t fall under the 10 year rule. They suggested to file a waiver to be forgiven of this, and seemed reasonable. Although we were obviously devastated  \nWe filed the visa within days. At the time, the wait time was 6-8 months, which was a reasonable gamble as 6 months and the daughter would still be under 21 and still a dependent, 8 months would be too long. Well, the estimated 6-8 turned into an estimated 28 months! Stupid covid. At that point, we decided that we couldn’t wait another 2.5 years-ish. We tried to get it expedited, but none of that worked. So we decided that I would move to Mexico. And get married there. We didn’t want it reach the 5 year mark. So I sold everything (I’m not rich but any stretch of the imagination, but I was Ok here, no debt besides the house (very small) and car. I sold everything and left for Mexico.  \nWe got married in April and I got my temporary residency card, and everything is great. I was still periodically checking on the waiver status, although we had all but given up on that since I had moved and the timeframe never changed. Then one day in September, I receive an email from our lawyer that the waiver was approved! We didn’t know what to do. We just wanted to trade to the US so we could both visit family and friends. So we couldn’t decide between another tourist visa or go for the marriage visa. The approved waiver doesn’t apply to a tourist visa from my understanding.   \nWell some Mexican shenanigans happened, and we both don’t want to deal with that anymore. So, we’ve decided to try for the marriage visa. I no longer have a decent paying job that could qualify as supportable, but I could get one once we move back. I would definitely have a place to live as all of my family would let us live with them until we were on our feet again. I still have some the money left from selling everything before I moved.   \nDoes all of this seem feasible? What roadblocks do you foresee? What shouldn’t we forget?  \nThank you.",

I have a question, and all lawyers I've spoken to have given me conflicting answers. \n\n I'm thinking of filing NIW after getting my initial OPT. I've had my case evaluated with wegreened, and they've offered me their refile until approved package. I'm hoping to bump up to EB1 after a few years, and only filing NIW for a priority date. Is it advisable to do this, since 1). I definitely won't be getting a GC through EB2; 2) I'll probably need at least 2-3 yrs to qualify for EB1; 2). In the meantime, I'll need an OPT extension, H1b, etc., want to travel,  and also give consular interviews for visa stamps. And these may be affected after filing an I140. \n\nIs is worth taking this risk for a priority date, especially for a backlogged country ? \n\nSome risk-averse lawyers told me to wait till getting H1B (who knows when the lottery will click). Others told me go for it even before graduating the PhD. What do people think? Please also feel free to point out if there are other threads discussing this... I didn't find any with conclusive answers.\n\nPS: Is it worth going for the refile until approved package with wegreened or should I wait? I know that probably means my case is borderline.",

(Unfortunately we suspect it was sent in with their original application for their greencard all the way back in the 80s or its just flat out been lost)\n\nWent to the consulate only to be told there was no b.c under their name or date in that state in Mexico.(side note their sons b.c who was born in the same state also doesn't exist and we suspect both were lost to poor handling) Their husband then in a rush finds and takes a baptism document without noting that the date is wrong(dont get me started on the anger this caused me). This is where the issues all starter. SS office then changes their birth year and says unless they bring in the b.c then they'll have to change all documents to this date now.\n\nFamily member then goes to mexico to find their birth certificate and again they're told it doesn't exist so they have register for a new b.c. They processed to do so. Come back to the US and SS office says no to the new b.C., it has to be the original or a document older than the baptism one for them to accept it. Apparently the new b.c isn't  accepted because \"anyone can say they were born anywhere at anytime and get one\" \n\nNow their renewal is coming up and it's a mess of fear that this will cause a denial.\n\nTheir birth certificate now says the og date but their ss says another and their greencard says the original date.\n\nWe thought about trying to get the og documents back but we're pretty sure that's a pipe dream and they were likely destroyed by now. \n\nWhat's the best course of action here? Should they renew their card and only after try to fix the date? Will they catch this and deny them? \n\nShould we just give up on the og date and fix everything to the date from the baptism document? Meaning get her new b.c changed to the date on the baptism so it matches up with her ss.\n\nI fear trying to fix it now that renewal is up will cause them to deny renewal but I also fear they'll catch that the ss has one date but her documents have another and deny them for \"lying\". \n\nIf their original birth certificate no longer eixist what can we possibly do to fix any of this?\n\n**Edit** To clarify and try to make it easier to understand \n\nSSA changed birth year on their records to 56 when birth year is 57, because original birth certificate is lost and a baptism certificate with the year of 56 was given to them to enroll in Medicare as they needed to do that year.\n\nRenewal for greencard is up. Greencard has the birth year of 57. All documentation has year of 57. Only SSA has 56. \n\nWorry is SSA records having the year 56 will cause issues and denial with greencard renewal as it doesn't match with date on greencard",

        "selftext": "My fiancé was just approved for his K1 Visa in Juárez. Yay! I wanted to post about our experience so that it can give others insight into their process as well.\n\nHere’s our timeline:\n\nApplication mailed: September 27, 2022\nApplication received by U.S.C.I.S: September 30, 2022\n\nNOA 1: October 5, 2022 - Mailed by U.S.C.I.S. California Service Center\n\nNOA 2: September 21, 2023 - Petition sent to NVC in Portsmouth, New Hampshire \n\nNVC email: October 11, 2023 - Confirmation of receipt of approved I-129F petition and forward to Consulate in Ciudad Juárez.\n\nConsulate Ciudad Juárez email: January 16, 2024 - Immigrant Visa Appointment and instructions \n\nMedical Appointment: February 8, 2024\nBiometrics Appointment: February 9, 2024\nDay 1 Document Drop Off: February 12, 2024\nDay 2 Interview: February 13, 2024\n\nQuestions asked during the interview:\n\nWhat is your fiancés name? \nWhere does your fiancé live? \nWhat does your fiancé do for work? \nDo you have children together? \nWhere was your child born? \nIs this your first marriage? Your fiancé’s first marriage?\nIs your fiancé an American citizen by birth or naturalization? \nWhere was your fiancé born? \nWhat will you do when you live in the USA? \nAnd finally ended with, “Welcome the the United States, your visa has been approved.”✅\n\nHere are my tips:\n\n1. Submit as much documents as you can when you initially file for the K1 visa, I mean a stack of documents. Be as heavy handed with the documents as possible send photos, copies of text messages, call logs, social media posts, discussions with family and friends trip re: fiancé, trip itineraries - everything. This will help with processing and the interview (they won’t ask for much documents in the interview). We submitted a huge folder of documents with colored tabs, separators, highlighted parts, cover sheet, all the works. During the interview they only requested both petitioner & beneficiary birth certificates, police certificates (beneficiary), sealed medical packet, form I-134 and 2022 tax return (we printed previous 3 year tax returns, employment letter, bank accounts, proof of residency other evidence but they only took my 2022 tax return).\n\n2. Bring the petitioner’s (U.S. citizen) birth certificate to the interview, a certified copy or the original will suffice. This is important, if you do not have it this will cause a delay in your case.\n\n3. When filling out the form I-134 Declaration of Support, you only need to meet the minimum income requirements - assets are a plus but are not necessary. Income > assets. The government will always prefer an income because it’s consistent and measurable, even if you have 200K in assets that’s still not considered stable unless you have a job. There is a table listed on the U.S.C.I.S. government website that will show you how much money you need to make in order to qualify. IF your income does not meet the required amount THEN you can list your assets to close that gap. There’s a formula they use to calculate the amount of assets you would need to cover  the gap (a quick google search to find it). Also, be careful when listing assets (house, car, property etc.) they will consider how much debt you have and there’s a whole process for assessing value to these assets that also might cause delays if not done properly or they might need additional information. This form in my opinion was the most tedious, confusing form but I found helpful guides on YouTube. \n\n4. Try to arrive to the consulate as early as you can, they do not check appointment times. My fiancé had an appointment at 9 am (for both days) and he was able to enter the consulate at 7am. There are hundreds of people at any given time waiting in line at the consulate, so just take that into consideration. No appointment, no entry. (Sorry petitioners, you shall not pass).\n\n5. The “interview” is spread out in the course of two days, the official appointment date that is listed in the email confirmation from the consulate is just to drop off documents. They will give you a second appointment for the following business day. The second appointment includes the infamous interview which is super quick, 5 minutes more or less.\n\n6. One sleepless night, I scoured the internet looking for any and all tips. I found one that read - the interview is just a formality, the decision has already been made prior to your arrival. (There are many check points, and the application could’ve been rejected before your interview. If rejected at the interview, it’s most likely because the consulate needs missing/more documents). If you see your hard copy file during the interview, try to look if there’s an “approval” stamp on the top page. If you see that, your visa has already been approved. (With the understanding that you’re not missing anything else on the day of the interview). My fiancé heard the same thing from the doctor at his medical appointment, and he saw it on the first day at the consulate for his document drop off. We didn’t put much weight on it, until it was approved.\n\nI wanted to share this for everyone who is going through this process and if you’re reading this, I hope it helps you! Best of luck to all the couples.",

Can anyone give some clarity regarding this issue? My fiancée is from Mexico. Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: the physical copy IS REQUIRED. During the pre check interview two days before the actual interview, my fiancée was told we would need the physical long form birth certificate, copies are not valid. I had to overnight the physical birth certificate to have it in time for her interview two days later. We had our interview in Ciudad Juarez.",

Being a valid GC holder (husband), would they expedite it?/ sorry for the stupid questions we are just panicking, and dont want to be in the UK at all.",

She, a Mexican citizen without any travel authorization to the US, has been estranged from her husband for many years. He went no-contact and she has had a difficult time finalizing her divorce in Baja California, Mexico. I am a US citizen and we are interested in pursuing the K1 visa to marry and live in California.\n\nMy question is this: Seeing as the state of Baja California has a two year waiting period before a divorcee can remarry and the state of California has a six month waiting period for the same, would we be able to solicit the K1 visa after six months of her being divorced, or would it be two years, or can we start immediately after her divorce decree is issued given the time it takes to approve the visa?\n\nEdit: I presume that it would take the full two years for our California marriage to be recognized by the authorities in Baja California but if someone has some insight on that aspect it would be helpful to know as well.",

Thanks to everyone who already read and responded to my previous post.\r  \n\r  \nI am a German citizen with a US Green Card, and my husband is a German and US citizen. We traveled to Mexico at the end of November 2022, and I gave birth to a daughter there in mid-December. She has Mexican citizenship with a birth certificate and passport.\r  \n\r  \nOriginally, we only planned to stay in Mexico until April/May. In early 2023, we tried to obtain a CRBA. Unfortunately, my husband could only prove 4.5 years of physical presence instead of the required 5 years, so it was unsuccessful.\r  \n\r  \nThen we tried to at least get a visa for her. We only got an appointment at the consulate in December 2024, and expediting the appointment was not possible. I asked for help here on Reddit, and I was pointed to 'Child born abroad to LPR' and according to the CBP website we met all requirements.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, we had some problems, and our return was delayed to mid-November – it was not planned, but I still thought we could enter with our baby since we still met all the requirements! Unfortunately, we were denied entry. We tried again the next day, and it still didn't work, despite presenting the information on paper and arguing that we meet all requirements!!\r  \n\r  \nThey argued that we had lived abroad for the last 11 months. We said it was not planned and it was still a temporary stay, and the website also states 'temporary stay abroad under 1 year'... I could also prove in writing that I am still employed in California. The officers were not interested at all. Both times we were treated very rudely and could only speak to someone through the fence.\r  \n\r  \nSince I had to enter due to my Green Card (funnily I had no issues at all entering the country by myself...) and job, my husband is now staying with our daughter in Mexico, and we are considering our options. Is there any way to appeal this decision? Do we even have a chance?\r  \n\r  \nOtherwise, we can now apply for the I-130. Does anyone know how long that currently takes? \n\nAlso, I can likely apply for US citizenship in April, and then theoretically, we could apply for CRBA again, this time without physical presence, right?\n\nAny other advice? I really miss my baby...\r  \n\r  \nThanks in advance for the help!",

He was given 221g and DS5535 because his visa category was changed. Civil documents and a new DS-260 were needed from my side. \n\nWe submitted all the required civil documents on the CEAC website as instructed. \nI read the form they gave him and it says submit all required ORIGINAL documents. Now do they mean birth cert, marriage cert, police clearance etc? Documents we already submitted on CEAC? \n\nOn the CEAC website the documents we uploaded still says submitted and hasn’t changed to accepted yet. \n\nTried calling and emailing to just make sure what we need to do and if we need to courier the docs but haven’t gotten a reply. Thought I’d ask here. \n\nThankyou",

        "selftext": "I'm a natural-born American citizen who has lived mostly in America except for when I occasionally go to visit my long-term girlfriend overseas. I'm a surgeon, so I can't travel much other than the occasional holidays. My girlfriend gave birth abroad. But both of them are overseas. I can't go overseas because of work. \n\nI know that American citizens can't be issued visas. But I'd like for my girlfriend and daughter to come. My girlfriend got offered a job in her company on L1. So I was wondering if my daughter is not yet a US citizen, thereby making her eligible for a L2 visa or ESTA (she has an ESTA eligible passport).\n\nHere are my reasons to believe my daughter is not a US citizen:\n\n* She is not legitimated. In the country she was born, I can't be added onto the birth certificate unless I marry my girlfriend, which I can't do because my girlfriend and I don't want to get married.\n\n* I haven't acknowledged my daughter under oath. I've just acknowledged her, but not under any formal legal oath.  Just when I send money, I'll say in the description box when I need to send money because of daughter's XYZ. \n\n* I haven't agreed in writing to support her until 18, although of course I have every intention of doing so.\n\nSo then she is not a citizen and thus eligible for the L2 visa. Would the Embassy still issue the visa because she isn't technically a citizen yet? I suppose we'd have to disclose I am the father. But she isn't technically a citizen. If the Embassy wouldn't issue her a visa, can she use ESTA? On ESTA would my girlfriend as the custodial parent have to say that my daughter is an American citizen?\n\nEDIT: The main reason besides the lack of marriage I can't be added is if I were to be added somehow, then my daughter would have to take my last name, but we want both of our last names to be given to our daughter.",

        "selftext": "Apparently these births should be handled quite differently than births where the child is born as a citizen of the same country. How do birth certificates or birth registration work in such cases? I normally hear the hospital reports to the government agency which in term the immigration department and puts the child under the same visa restrictions as the parents. But what happens when its time for parents to return. Ie end of assignment, lease and visa?\n\nWhile the child is technically automatically a citizen of parent's country in most cases many times countries need to authenticate birth and parents marriage certificates from the nearest counsulate or embassy where it was issued to prove legitimacy in order to grant a passport which can be rather difficult process for some people. What would happen if the kid returns home and parents never were able to complete the process. The parents may be married at remote state or country. Ie if kid born on the road in Mexico than the parents who are US citizens or one of the a US citizen just drives to the US border and say that is their child? If the child makes it over would they still need to go through the process or that kid despite being technically a US citizen under US nationality laws by descent may still be treated as an undocumented person?\n\nEdit: Mexico is a Jus Soli country and the kid would be registered as a Mexico national by birth at a Mexican hospital but many countries i.e homogenius east asian countries are not that way. \n\nEdit: many in US wants to amend the 14th amendment so that birthright citizenship is restricted to at least legal residents. Though what would be the unintended consequences should US, Canada or the rest of the Americas follow much of the world(aside from Aus, New Zealand) in this. UK and ireland could be an example as they “recently” ended unconditional jus soli. Ie we would have many undocumented kid born in the US causing quite an issue.",

        "selftext": "I've got a tricky (and potentially interesting) case. Doing my best to keep identities private while including enough details...\n\nMy 34 yo significant other (SO) is a German citizen, who came to US (California) to study on a 6mo education visa in Jan 2020. OS arrived just as COVID started and was afraid to travel after 6 month visa expired. SO applied for a visa extension for June 2020, but didn't hear back in time, so ended up staying, afraid they would not be able to return to US if they returned to Germany, bc of Covid. OS got a job (under the table) in order to finish a two year long educational program, then found a place to live and ended up staying until April 2023, continuing to work to afford education in Ayuvredic healing.\n\nSO hadn't seen their family since pre-covid so very much wanted to visit Germany in April 2023. A friend of SO (also German)  suggested a way to do this, which the friend had already tried-- exit via the Mexican border, get a phony visa stamp, then return to USA.\n\nSO felt they had no other choice bc of overstaying initial visa, so followed this suggestion. Unfortunately it didn't work out :(\n\nSO had requested an official visa extension in June 2020, but never got a response from US govt. So, upon deciding to leave in April 2023, SO felt that they needed a visa stamp dated after June 2020, when extension was applied for.\n\nSO arranged a meeting with a provider of false visa stamps at Mexican border and met them in April 2023 at the Mexican border. and received a \"document\" rather than a passport stamp, suggesting SO had exited US via Mexico in August 2020.\n\nSO made it back to Germany, but when they came back to California a month later, after visiting their family, SO was stopped at US airport border because their documents said that they crossed over the USA-Mexico border in August 2020 when the border was closed at that time b/c of COVID. (Unclear why phony visa stamp provider wasn't aware of this or didn't choose a different date :(When detained upon re-entry to CA, SO was interrogated, said they were coming back to US to \"wrap up affairs and return to Germany\".\n\nUnder pressure, SO admitted to details of visa fraud. SO also fraudulently represented bank account info, said they had $15k instead of $2k for purposes of re-entering US, using a photoshopped image of bank account. OS says they did this in a panicked state.Unfortunately all of this is recorded on deportation documents :(\n\nFor some reason , SO was given a five year ban instead of 10 year ban, as would be standard for 3+ years of overstaying visa.\n\nAfter research and reaching out, a US immigration lawyer has recommended not to take any actions before the 5 year ban is over because SO should actually be banned for 10 years for overstaying visa for over 12 months.\n\nFrom my perspective, as a very fortunate US citizen, 5 years is a very a long time, 10 years is a very very long time. And from what I've read there is a strong possibility that SO might never be able to get a US visa again, even after ban is lifted. that is a very very cery long time that will mean my family never get to meet my SO with our child.\n\nSO is a wonderful person, who got spooked by COVID craziness and made some bad choices under pressure. SO is the love of my life, so I am moving to Germany to marry them, and we plan to have children in the next year or two.\n\nIt would very sad if my elderly parents would not be able to meet our future child, or if the only way they could meet our children is for me to return solo to US with my children but without my SO. I and my SO are both hard-working people, trained as healers, organic farmers, and artists.\n\nI would be SO happy to find a way to bring my SO and our future children back to the US to reunite with my family and friends, sooner than the 5 year (or 10 year or lifetime) ban. The idea of a life-long ban is crushing, as SO is a healer and force for good in the world. They feel much more at home in US than Germany and want to contribute to life and healing here in the US. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\\[edited for typos\\]",

The format of the names are:\n\n[Village name] [Father's name] [First name] \n\nTo complicate things further, people use initials for the Village Name and the Father's name. So on my birth certificate my name is written literally as \"Q.R. Peter\" (example). When I was young they started instituting mandatory expansion of the initials. So my name became Queens Richard Peter. But this was the name in my \"Given name\" field in the passport. So my B1/B2 visa had FNU because no surname.\n\nThen when I renewed my passport, I got my name fixed so that the \"Surname\" was \"Queens\" and the \"Given name\" is Richard Peter. The passport office in my country is pretty understanding of these situations and they didn't mind putting the Village Name as the surname. But, I am not Richard. I am Peter. \n\n1. Can I file for a court application for a name change even though I'm not a US citizen or LPR? Can I fix it so that my first name is my first name and my dad's name is my middle name?\n\n2. Can I submit this name change for SEVIS? Or SEVIS only goes by what is there on my passport. In which case, I would need passport renewal. Does this mean I need a new I-20?",

        "selftext": "\n\nHello everyone! I just gave birth to a sweet baby boy here in CDMX and I live here with my husband who is a Mexican citizen. My Son and I need to go back to the United States mid September. \n\nWe have started the process of getting his passports already: My appointment at the US consulate for his CRBA *(Consular Report of Birth Abroad)* is not until September 5th- I have read that after the appointment I can apply for his US passport which may take 8-12 weeks to receive. I have also requested for my child’s Birth Certificate at the Registro Civil and will need to go through the process of getting his Mexican passport as well but saw that that may take 8 weeks too. \n\nMy question is:\n\nIf I do not receive either passport before mid September will I still be able to travel to the US as long as I present his Mexican certificate of birth (the form I received at the hospital) or his Mexican Birth Certificate? Since I am his mother and am a U.S. citizen? Will they allow us to enter?\n\nHad any one else been through the process of getting a CRBA and child’s passport  in CDMX? How long did it take? Do you have any tips for our appointment so we make sure everything goes smoothly? \n\nIf you did not have either passports, were you able to travel back to the states with your newborn without any passport/ CRBA as long as you can prove you are the parent? We will be entering by land from CDMX to Tijuana via the Cross Border Express and crossing to California. \n\nI also read online that if he has his Mexican passport he can go to the US as long as I present my US Passport. Is this true? If so I am hoping that he gets the Mexican passport soon.\n\nI was able to find this info on help.cbp.gov : \n\n*Children- Travel Documents for infants\nEach American citizen must possess his or her own passport. U.S. and Canadian citizen infants are not required to have a passport for travel by land or sea - although they are required to present a copy of a birth certificate and, if not traveling with both parents, the Department of State suggest a consent letter accompany the other parent(s) due to the rise in instances of child abduction in custody cases, and a growing number of children who are the victims of trafficking.\n\nWhen U.S. citizen children under the age of 16 arrive by land or sea from Canada or Mexico they may present an original or copy of their birth certificate, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or a Naturalization Certificate. \n\nIf traveling domestically, a passport is not needed but If you are driving into the United States (U.S.) and have not yet received a birth certificate for a U.S. or Canadian citizen infant, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer will accept: the birth record issued by the hospital, a letter on hospital letterhead or a letter from the doctor who delivered the child providing details of the birth, including the name of the child, time and place of birth, and the parent(s) named*\n\nFrom what I understand it says to present a copy of birth certificate, but how soon will I receive his American birth certificate after his CRBA appointment? Or is his Mexican one okay? Or Will I receive a form after my CRBA appointment on Sept 5th that will allow him to travel with me? \n\nAll of this is a lot to navigate with a newborn so any help is much appreciated. Thank you for reading and for any advice",

It’s probably not a new question but I couldn’t find answers yet. \n\nLong story short, I left my home country (India) to move to US to pursue higher education 6 years ago. I am currently on H1 visa, my wife (a dependent on my visa until she is lucky enough to be picked in the lottery) is also employed. We make good money and are successful in our careers. I have a sibling who is a Swedish citizen, who also has no way (from what we understood) to have our single, dependent parent to live with him for a longer time with a resident permit or equivalent. \n\nI have no hopes of a GC given my country of birth. Even if I had a GC, there’s no way to bring my dependent parent to US ever. She has a tourist visa but I am sure visiting here for 6 months every year, she will be denied entry at some point, even if she doesn’t actually abuse the visa (and doesn’t take any illegal employment). I am just annoyed by this system and I am ready to leave US. \n\nSo I am looking for recommendations on which countries are best suited. I am also open to explore a golden/investment visa, depending on the cost In my next home, I want two freedoms - \n1. Mainly I want to be in a country that supports bringing your dependent parent in, without them having to travel every 6 months or go through some stupid immigration check that looks down on her. \n\n2. I don’t want to be tied/limited to one employer and be able to pursue contract/business/startup income opportunities. Not a deal breaker but nice to have. \n\nTLDR: which countries (that are deemed good places to live of course) will allow a high skilled worker to bring a dependent parent with a permit to reside with them. \n\nThank you for your advise",

But here's the issue: she is a mother to a 1 year old son, who I love and support working from LA. The father abandoned the child and the mother right after the birth. He left to another country altogether. At first he sent alittle money but he hasn't sent anything for 6 months and has not seen the child since he left. My fiance does not ever want to co parent with her ex for various reasons. \n\nMy question is does anyone know what the time frame is for abandonment in mexico? Or where to start with this? We are gonna find an attorney but I wanted to get as much info as I could here.\nWe're trying to do the whole nine: change the last name, remove him as parent because we don't see him being cooperative in signing anything for the son to come with her to California with me. \nI read something about if he hasn't seen the child in 6 months we can do something.  It's been a year since any physical contact with the child.\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated",

Their father is a U.S. citizen, and we were never married. I have cared of them since I gave birth to them, and he has never gave responsibility for them. Now, I'd like to file citizenship for them to allow them to start studying in the U.S. The problem comes when of course, I need their father's complete attention and consent on the process of naturalization. I can't get in direct contact with him because his couple doesn't allow him to talk to me (which obviously is not an acceptable reason) so I can't continue with the process because I need information and consent from him. Of course, we can deduct that this lady is aware of the possibility of me requesting child support. So, I'd really appreciate your advise 🙏Should I sue for child support? Remember I am still Mexican as well as my twins. Or should I continue trying to file the naturalization process by myself? Or is there another suggestion? The twins and I live in Mexico, and he lives in U.S.\n\nThank you so much for your attention ❤️",

Unfortunately it was denied.\n\nThe letter states that she can reapply, but she needs stronger ties, involving: professional work, school, family, or social links. She mentioned she has a food stand and she has family in the states. Given what is in the letter it wasn’t enough and I am wondering what is something she can do to strengthen her ties. \n\nI feel like it’s pretty obvious that some type of work or school would help. But I’m just not sure, how she could integrate herself in those fields. She didn’t receive a proper education which I feel limits most of those areas. I’m trying to brainstorm, but all that comes to mind are possible solutions but almost immediately my brain suggests why such idea wouldn’t be enough. \n\nShe doesn’t have any plans to work in the country. It is for a genuine tourist visa . From what I’ve heard a lot of people have abused this process to eventually stay in the country. \n\nI was thinking that maybe she’d like to come to my graduation next year in June or she’d love to see her family who she hasn’t seen in years but, I feel those aren’t solutions to our problem. \n\nAny suggestions would be a major help as we’d like to implement some type of solution as soon as possible and give proof that she is trying. I was wondering if anybody here has experienced something similar or what their family member, friend, or just someone you know. And what they did to become successful during the interview.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, so this was an extremely sad week this week for my wife and I. My wife has lived in the United States now for 28 years. She came into the US with her mom when she was 16 and her mom never took take of her papers, only her own. My wife and I married in 2017 and decided to get this out of the way beginning in 2018. It was June 2022 we were documentarily completed, petition and waiver of unlawful entry all approved. We received the interview appointment in March 2023 and began preparing for everything. All documents, evidence, everything was nicely organized and a nice handheld organizer and labeled to be a professional as possible. We ever got her police report even though it was technically not required. There was nothing that was not ready for the interview day. Here we are on Thursday 5/25 and my wife emerges from the consulate about to burst into tears. She was refused and handed a blue sheet of paper and told we would receive and email for a DS-5535.\r  \n\r  \nUpon review of what the DS-5535 even was and the email specifically stating to email the responses to the seven questions to the email provided. She was given her passport back and sent on her way. We later find out that the DS-5535 is taking months and months if not over a year to hear anything back. This is where it got really bad. My wife has lived in Dallas for 28 years and and we have a life together in Dallas. My wife owns two house she pays taxes on and we live in my home where she has her minor child and my mentally disabled son she helps to care for. She has nothing in Mexico. She has no family, no house, no nothing, and she was dealt with this ridiculous request that has no end date in sight.\r  \n\r  \nOur attorney says to email congress and senator and he'll also submit an inquiry. I just cannot comprehend how these interviewers can get on these ridiculous power trips that are seriously unjustified. The whole purpose of the DS-5535 is extreme vetting for national security risks. My wife is a petite 4'10\" little mexican lady who has only ever been in Mexico and the US. All of her previous documents were approved and she even had extra approvals with the unlawful entry waiver. How can one human being not see the situation what what it is rather than getting on a power trip can throwing the only thing you can at her, a DS-5535. I think because of Trump and and others alike they are hatters for the immigrants and making unjust decisions. They have no business approving people for Visas. This process should not be a one way process only where the interviewer is the only one who knows why. Just like in the US, you are allegedly innocent until proven guilty. The facts must be presented from BOTH sides, not just one. In this case is is entirely unfair because the interview holds the cards and has no accountability to the affected person and provide some justification for asking for more information. My wife was unfairly judged and ultimately for something she had no control over when her mom brought her into the United States. My wife simply made the best of her life. My was was NEVER on government provided services like food stamps, medicaid, nothing like that. She worked and stood on her own two feet.\r  \n\r  \nAs a legally born US Citizen, rest assured I will not stop and there will be some accountability to this system. It is abused by interviewers and I absolutely will NOT stand around and just let the system work itself out. I am a hardworking US Citizen who met a lovely lady who is now my wife and we are both paying the price for this unjustified interviewers decisions. Get ready for some hell raising!",

She has the Mexican citizenship now.\n\nWe then tried to do the birth abroad (CRBA) at the U.S.consulate in the city where we are, but unfortunately, the documents to proof my husband's physical presence (5 years) in the U.S. prior to her birth weren't sufficient enough. We should have more documents in the U.S. that we can submit later. \n\nWe then applied for a B2 Visa for her to be able to bring her to the U.S. and we got the earliest available interview appointment in November 2024. Unfortunately, our request for an expedited appointment was denied. I'm currently checking the website several times every day for an earlier appointment in case someone else cancels the appointment. That's what the consulate told us. So far without success...\n\nWe both have to return to work in May in California and right now we have no idea how to bring our baby girl with us to the U.S.!\n\nI already called the consulate, the U.S. citizen emergency contact number, Border Protection and Department of State without success. Last week we went to the consulate again in person and still have no solution. It's getting ridiculous...\n\nAny ideas what we can do...?! What happens if we just try to enter the U.S. without a VISA for our baby?\n\nThanks in advance!!",

        "selftext": "In over two decades of life, I have hardly lived in my home country of India (only around 4 years) and this was not even during the foundational or advanced years of my pre-adult life but my formative years (basically 2nd-5th grade). \n\nBefore living in India, I lived in the Mediterranean immersed in Judeo-Christian and Islamic lifestyle. My parents left India days after my birth. So, my foundational years were spent in a mix of an Indian and English speaking household with parents of two religions and having friends of nearly three to four religions and a multitude of languages. This is the first count against my Indian identity in that I am extremely heterogeneously mixed in both language and culture. \n\nWhen living in India, I found it very hard to bond to the culture. I went to a private international school that had a mix of foreign and domestic students and primarily conducted education in English. I regularly failed my domestic language classes, having a greater affinity for the foreign languages. The most I could enjoy was the food. My parents saw this and we left for United States where I started 6th grade. This is the second count against my Indian identity in that I seemed to have an intrinsic otherness to it.\n\nI went through the entire middle school, high school, and college life in United States. I didn't care much of my immigration, thinking I was going to be fine being a potluck of so many cultures and experiences. This is the third count against my Indian identity in that even the Western biases (I call it this as a way to distinguish cultural, ethical, and metatheoretic inducing that the culture has that's distinct from the Indian equivalent) of education were highly internalized to my psyche. It wasn't until I was taken off my dependency status from my parents and faced the dehumanization of my entire identity to just another working immigrant that my psyche started to appear as a discarded persona, forcing me to adopt another co-psyche.\n\nI've been involved in many churches, mosques, and hillels. Its a recent occurrence that I am fraternizing with the graduate student body which is significantly immigrant that I am getting any sort of first degree connection (most has been second degree through books and philosophical treatments of Indian subcontinent religious development) to my culture. Even then, its more rocky than I'd want it to be and not as easy to make as with American relationships. This strengthens the second count even further.\n\nA lot of these feelings are taking over me and its giving me a hard time to work towards my own cause because I'm at a point where I feel neither America nor India would take me. I don't even have the SSN equivalent documents for India which is given to every American here (I think) when they are born. Now that I'm cracking into my professional life in America, I feel like I have to behave like an immigrant now even though I have the mannerisms and upbringing of a domestic person. I have to tell employers my status and they infer what they do of the average immigrant. \n\nMy question is are these feelings unfounded? Do I actually have to assume my true spirit and force myself to learn a culture my parents don't even want me to go back to? They speak about H1B, etc. What is the ethic surrounding this geopolitical quandary? Am I actually still bound to my home country even if I don't internally feel any identity to it? Why do I need to keep lying to immigrant officers that I have intent to return to the country to contribute to it? I don't believe it is natural at all for a human to take on so many identities. \n\nI am open to philosophical or legal discussions. Please ask for any further clarifications.",

        "selftext": "I'll start this post with some of the facts of our case. My wife and I were married in the US on August 10, 2020. She is from Mexico and returned there after our wedding. I started our immigration paperwork in October 2020 through USCIS. We received approval of the I-130 on 09/24/21 and the case was sent to the NVC. Our case was approved by the NVC and marked documentarily complete on 01/03/2022. We have been waiting for an interview date in Ciudad Juarez since then.\n\nMy question is whether there is any information available that will help us estimate when her interview date might be scheduled. The NVC releases monthly backlog reports that show how many DC cases were assigned interview dates each month but I'm not sure how helpful those are as they don't specify the numbers by embassy. I've called to the NVC and the embassy in Juarez, sent emails to both, and have gotten nowhere. I've also contacted one of my Senators for assistance and not gotten much help there, either.\n\nAccording to the backlog reports, when we were first given the DC notice in January 2022, there were 465k IV applicants who were documentarily approved and waiting for interviews. However, it's my understanding (I could very well be wrong, though) that IR-1 visas have priority over certain other IV categories, with the exception of certain asylum cases, so I'm not sure whether we actually would have started in the back of the line or not. If there is a priority given, it certainly doesn't feel like it. lol. \n\nI realize I'm not going to get any definitive date or anything. I also realize that Ciudad Juarez is one of the busiest embassies in the world and the current situation at the border may very well be causing some delay as well. However, I'm hoping there are some resources available that might help us understand what cases are currently under review or something. The hardest part about this whole process has been the not knowing. My wife and I have both said that even if the interview was another year away, we would feel better just knowing that there's a date to look forward to. So, any resource that can help us calculate a somewhat-accurate estimate of where the embassy is currently at would help lift our spirits.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated...\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "I am in a rather complicated situation. 22 years ago I committed a monumental stupidity. I use the word monumental as a qualifier because it truly opened my eyes to the wrong choices I made two decades ago. Rewinding my life to the year 2000, I committed a crime that redefined my life in a negative way. Regret... yes, very much but it's too late for that and I am unable to time-travel back to correct those foolish and irresponsible actions, the consequences of which I am now confronted with. The crime was counterfeiting currency. I reproduced or \"cloned\" 60 pieces of 50 Euro banknotes (bills, if you're an American reading this) and spent them with a whatever-they'll-never-find-out-it-was-me attitude. Little did I know (and this is why I aptly began this story with the phrase \"monumental stupidity\" above) that police in my country have some of the most sophisticated tools for solving crimes, even those perpetrated by perfectionist offenders. I underestimated them.\n\nAfter spending the entire lot of my own version of 50 Euros, I got my first inkling of dark clouds ahead when a family member called me to say that police were making inquiries about my whereabouts. I can still vividly remember having that conversation on that iconic Nokia 3310, dazed and asking myself how I was so quickly and positively identified as the source of these fake Euros, how to deal with the prospect of a prison sentence and the effect this criminal record will have on my future, how to explain this to those who I least wanted to disappoint in my life and endless other hows, whys and whats.\n\nBeing a coward, I decided to not deal with the consequences. I left Europe and arrived somewhere in Asia (I won't say where for my privacy and because of how this story further unravels). I will redact the irrelevant bits, like what happened in the many years that followed. I basically created and lived a new life for myself. The first few years were lonely and rather quiet. I knew back then that criminals were almost always caught when they made that fatal mistake of contacting their families and friends back home and revealing their whereabouts or asking for money to be transferred which creates a traceable transaction or paper trail. Eventually friendships and relationships were established during my 22 years abroad. Some of them evolved to very close friendships and led to fateful decisions which I will briefly write about now.\n\nIn 2003 I mentioned my predicament to a friend of mine (a local of the country I am in now) and told him the entire story. He was and is still very understanding and after listening to my (mis)adventure he thought it only existed in movies but he promised to help find a solution. I was both grateful and also surprised because I never asked for help in the first place. It didn't take long for him to suggest one. Within a few weeks he invited me for dinner at his parents' home. After dinner, he mentioned that his brother knew someone who worked at the local birth registry office. Curious, I listened intently. He then mentioned that a friend of a friend would be willing, for 2k USD, to have his birth certificate used for applying for a passport under his name but with my picture on it. This friend of a friend was disabled, around my age, never traveled and had no intention of ever traveling internationally in the future. After what seemed to be an eternity of silence, I noticed he was looking at me and waiting for me to say something. I quickly switched to analyst mode, weighing the pros, cons and risks in my mind. I asked how this could be achieved when I couldn't speak the language fluently yet and if this could endanger the passport application process, he quickly dismissed this concern with a wave and said a travel agent will take care of everything. He raised his beer bottle and said cheers.\n\nI got the passport and have since that year (2003) moved on with my life. I established a company, opened bank accounts, built an impeccable credit history, bought a house and led a life without any infractions and trouble with local laws (apart of course from this closely guarded secret of having a borrowed identity). When I left my home country, I needed just 3 semesters to complete an undergraduate degree. Anxious to have academic credentials for a more solid standing in society, I studied part time locally and graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in business.\n\nFast forward to last year. I was having a cup of coffee one morning and reading the local headlines on my iPad. COVID this, COVID that. Travel bans and countries locked down. Now here's an article about vaccines and there's one about so many COVID deaths in Italy. Then boom... I see it. An article about the government introducing a new e-passport, completely redesigned and incorporating a new system  linked to Interpol's databases. Ironically, it's funded by the EU with most of the logistics handled by, you guessed it, the country I'm originally from. Next to the article was a video of masked government officials proudly showing off the new passport system and how it scanned law enforcement databases and international AFIS systems in real time. One immigration officer talks about the advantages of the new passport and how the biometric identifiers stored in the passport's chip are now checked against international police databases.     \n\nAfter reading this, I discussed this new development with my friend. At first, he dismissed it but I pressed on and told him not to ignore the level of sophistication of this new e-passport technology. After a few weeks of serious thoughts, I decided it was time to expect a day of reckoning and that the earlier I prepared the less unpleasant the outcome.\n\nSo I come to the final part of this story. I intend to settle my affairs in this country. I will close my bank accounts, sell my land and house (I already have an offer) and return this borrowed identity to the rightful owner. After 22 years on the run, I plan to fly back to Europe and surrender to my country's authorities. In the meantime, I applied for a passport at the embassy because the one I had when I left Europe expired 19 years ago. The embassy made inquiries back home (they always do when a passport is applied for) and told me there is \"something\" on the system preventing a full passport from being issued. As a result, I am eligible for an ETD only. ETD stands for emergency travel document and it is valid for travel to my country only. It doesn't allow travel to other countries.  Great. This means I'm still wanted.\n\nNow this is the dilemma I am in now and it's the reason for posting this story here on reddit :\n\nI have to (must!) leave this country with the local passport. This is because the ETD from my country has no record of entry and therefore no record of me ever entering here under my real name. Using it at the airport to fly to Europe might lead to me being detained, a thought I am not fond of when I think about local prison conditions here. I therefore plan to fly from here (country X) to an assumed destination (in this case, Mexico). I use the word assumed because I have no intention of completing all legs of the journey. The local passport allows visa-free travel to Mexico and no transit visa is required for my country in Europe. I will therefore fly directly from this country to my country's airport like this:\n\nMy current country --> ZRH (my country's main international airport which allows transits without visa)\n\nand not board the second leg to Mexico. \n\nAt the airport, I will present my ETD to immigration and I expect to be detained for the offence I committed 22 years ago.\n\nMy question is if this is something that can be done realistically, given how I am not familiar with how airport transit arrangements work. Will I be liable to pay or reimburse the airline for \"skipping\" the second and return legs of this booking? Will the flight to Mexico just leave without me or will one less passenger on the manifest trigger a large-scale hunt for me at the airport.

        "selftext": "I was airlifted to the U.S. from Haiti with my (adoptive) brother because of the earthquake in 2010.  My US-born adoptive parents had already started the adoption process. The U.S. airlifted over 1000 children, and those who were in our category were handed over to custody of adoptive parents.\n\nThe adoption was incomplete in Haiti. The U.S. adopted this law at the end of 2010 that states that the adoptees could just their status from \"humanitarian parole\" to \"green card\" - deadline of 3 years.https://www.uscis.gov/archive/green-card-through-the-help-haiti-act-of-2010.\n\nI came with my brother and was admitted on humanitarian parole.  Our parents finalized our adoption in Illinois in 2010 at the court (there are photos) and we were given Illinois \"record of foreign birth\" with our adoptive parents' names and dates of births.  https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/birth-death-other-records/adoption.html\n\nMy parents did NOT adjust my status or my brother's status before 2013.  When we finished high school, we realized that we did not have proper documentation to get SSN (or so we thought).  We hired a lawyer to apply for EADs and GCs.  My brother and I received our green cards at the ages of 22 and 21 respectively. We have not yet had them for 5 years.\n\nMy brother and I now want to travel abroad, so we went to get passports recently.  I thought he went to the Haitian consulate, so I was confused when he came home with a U.S. passport.  It turns out he went to the passport agency NOT the Haitian consulate and got a U.S. passport.  Took 6 months.  https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/x6i0do/my_brother_got_a_us_passport_as_pr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nI wanted to get a Haitian passport to travel to Thailand (it’s supposed to be here in 3 weeks) but now I am confused if my brother and I are entitled to U.S. passports.  I called USCIS yesterday twice. The first officer said that yes, I was a US citizen, the second officer said no, yes, and then eventually admitted she does not know and safe someone from USCIS would call me.\n\nIf I go to the passport agency with my green card and a filled out DS11 form with my brother, and if I get a U.S. passport (both officers told me I should apply), am I in any danger of misrepresenting myself as a U.S. citizen. I don't know whether I am, and I don't know if the lawyer we hired gave us bad advice.\n\nFINALLY, here is some reading on some government and law association articles on the Haitian orphans who were airlifted in 2010.https://www.aila.org/File/DownloadEmbeddedFile/53055\n\nI believe I am category 2 (paroled into US not no actual adoption or grant of legal custody in Haiti).   Link to law of December 2010 outlining how Haitian orphans get status adjusted.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ293/pdf/PLAW-111publ293.pdf\n\nMy question is - if i get a US passport, am I safe to use it if I present all the information (green card, Illinois record of foreign birth, my parents' US birth certificates)? Also could I be a us citizen and just had not known?",

Gma obtained a green card shortly after but never got her daughter (Y) a green card despite never knowing a life outside of America. 36 years later Y hasn't been able to afford to naturalize, and in 2020 lost her vision due to health issues leading to increasing financial struggles and risk of homelessness. I want to know what options she may have because this was a situation caused by her mom that she's never been able to resolve.\n\nAt this time gma is still a green card holder. all 4 of Y's children are legal US citizens. her children are 22 (A), 19, 15, and 12 no one has enough money to support the family yet so we need to get her at least legal enough to obtain social assistance of some kind so she doesn't end up homeless since she is unable to work due to her disability.\n\nEdit: we aren't sure if Y's mother (Gma) brought her legally or not but we assume so as Gma later obtained her greencard, but we think she assumed that her baby was covered automatically. Because of this assumption she never got any paperwork for her child, ultimately screwing Y over. Y now doesn't have any proof of how she entered the country and doesn't have any citizenship even though her mom is a LPR and her sisters and children are citizens and Y has lived in America her entire life up to this point.",

I also have had stints of living in Mexico, Singapore and Japan. I'm fluent in English and Spanish and speak some Mandarin. However, my (cis) partner is a US citizen, has never lived abroad/barely traveled abroad and only speaks English.\n\nLiving outside of the US on its own is not a problem, but I hate that I'm feeling forced to make plans to leave my home because of the constant attacks on transgender folks coming from the Trump administration. Despite all of America's flaws, I love my life in the US. I have a great job, live very comfortably, amazing friends, half of my family lives here, and get to admire the stunning beauty of the PNW every day. Given my dual citizenship and having lived abroad, I've always considered living in the US as a decision I actively choose to make and that if I wanted to live else where in the world, I can likely make it happen. Where there's a will, there's a way kinda thing - with limitations of course.\n\nIt's just heartbreaking that I'm having to make a decision if I want to stay here for my personal safety. I don't want to leave the life I've created for myself over the past 15 years. I'm lucky that my state has strong protections, but the Trump admin is repeatedly showing its disregard for the rule of law and I highly doubt they are going to slow down on trampling on civil liberties. The most difficult part about this is having my partner come with me. She's always lived near her immediate family, and is struggling with the idea of potentially moving to a non-English speaking country, despite recognizing the move would be likely a last-minute decision if the worst comes to happen for safety purposes. The options she's been the most receptive to are Canada, New Zealand and the UK, specifically Scotland, but none of them are particular easy or quick to emigrate to.\n\nOur most easiest options for a move to an LGBTQ friendly country are Chile or Portugal. Mercosur countries would also be easy, with Uruguay being the only one I'd truly consider. It's possible that I could get a skilled worker visa without having to change jobs (I work remotely) - looking primarily at Canada and Australia - or get job sponsorship for immigration purposes, though that would require switching positions.\n\nIs anyone trans and/or queer and are dealing with similar feelings of being pushed out of your home country because of politics? Do people have any advice on how to make my partner more comfortable with a potential move abroad to a country that she doesn't particularly desire to go to/is afraid of a ton of culture shock? I guess I'm looking for some solidarity or words of encouragement during these tough times..",

He is highly educated with a PhD from the U.S., a professor and journalist, and was invited to attend this basically as training. It's a huge deal and he is very excited about it. He has a letter of invitation from the international organization whose headquarters for this region are based in D.C.\n\nWe are at a stage of relationship where we are planning to begin a family. We are saving for a home. We have a life here and I have no intention or interest to return to the US and even cancelled my trip for later this year. I am fully invested in our relationship, we have two pets and we share all the important core values.\n\nAfter I read about the Brown university professor who was detained and deported despite having an active H1B visa and a court order halting her deportation, and the German tourist who was detained by CBP, I am afraid for my partner to go to this conference in the US. I have been sending him articles about these situations. I am also angry at this international organization that has invited multiple people from developing countries in Latin America to come to the U.S. for the 3 day conference despite everything going on when it would have been easier and made more sense to meet in Mexico. The organization is based in Europe so it's not even an American org. \n\nI am also a person of color so I generally don't trust law enforcement in the US and know that not truly being a threat does not matter, especially now with the changes that allow detaining foreigners without due process. I have this terror that he will go and dissappear and maybe be shipped off to an El Salvador prison the administration is paying to detain people who will probably never be released or seen ever again.\n\nCan someone please share anything that can help? Am I being ridiculous? We have been arguing about it and he is frustrated with me, especially because I'm American and don't want him to go to my own country which  admit sounds weird.  But I am afraid he might be underestimating the risk. I also am concerned I might be overreacting. He sad it's driving him crazy and even cried about how stressful my fear is for him. He has said I'm not being supportive of this huge opportunity he earned (and he has earned it and I am proud). Tbh if he was going to any other country I would not feel this way. \n\nIt's just hard to know what to expect and how to act under these circumstances. And me being an immigrant myself and from the US makes it even more complicated.\n\n**UPDATE**: Thank you to everyone who offered validation and level-headed reassurance and ways to think through this. I apologized for letting my fear cause him so much distress, and he has expressed that I'm right to be worried, he is too and he is now leaning towards not going after some further reflection. He has reached out and let the organization know this to see if there are alternatives to the location or other ways to participate given the unpredictable and rapidly changing US border situation. I'm feeling less stressed since we're back on the same page. ",

Having grown up with a pool and a mom who also teaches swimming lessons, our kids love the water. We love to vacation in Mexico and the Caribbean. Some of our favorite spots that we have been to are Isla Mujeres, Cozumel, Jamaica and St Lucia. Roatan and the USVI are next on our list of places to visit.\n\nGiven that my wife and kids have summer break and I have the ability to work remotely for short periods of time (up to about 30 days or so, as needed) we’ve been kicking around the idea of doing an extended vacation this summer or summer of 2026 before the kids start getting too busy with sports, friends, etc. I’m thinking we‘ll go somewhere in the Caribbean, find a month long rental, and stay for 30 days or so. The goal would be to allow the kids to experience a different culture, make some new friends, and sneak in some quality family time near some clear blue water. With this, we’d also love to find some kind of structured fun/learning/day camp experiences for our kids. In doing some research, I stumbled across this Junior Ocean Explorers program put on by the University of the Virgin Islands. Basically, a program for elementary aged kids to learn more about the ocean and marine biology. The incorporate swimming, snorkeling, learning about different plants and animals, etc.\n\nSomething like this would be absolutely perfect for our older two kids, however, it appears they would not be eligible as we don’t live in/have family in the Virgin Islands and that is one of the eligibility requirements. With that, I’m wondering if there are any other programs out there that would offer a similar type of experience? Basically, we’re hoping to find something fun and educational, ideally somewhere in the Caribbean, where our kids can try something new and make some new friends in the process. Bonus points if it involves the water, but that wouldn’t be a requirement. It doesn’t need to be 4 full weeks, and doesn’t have to be an all-day thing. If we can‘t find anything like this, we may start looking at some of the Montessori schools on the various islands to see if they offer any type of part-time summer programs. We really just want to give the kids an opportunity to experience something new and make some new friends in the process.\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts/suggestions!",

And by that I mean a year or more in one of several places.\n\nI’m thinking about traveling between Europe, sea, and South America.  But I’d rather have long term visas and possible residency to make it easier.\n\nMy concern is, to get long term visas or residency, you typically have to have recent documents, like criminal background checks.  I don’t want to have to go back to the U.S. in between to get new checks run every time I’m going to a new country to stay for a year.  How long are apostilles good for anyways on birth certificates or marriage certificates?\n\nHow do those Capital nomad guys get residency so easily when they’ve given up their citizenship in the U.S.?\n\nI’m just confused on how you manage to provide recent docs when you move around.\n\nHow do others handle this?",

        "selftext": "Good Afternoon, r/expats,\n\nI am honestly feeling kind of lost right now, which is why I'm asking on this sub. I hope you guys, some of you pretty familiar with immigration processes, might be able to point me into a direction of who to talk to etc. - if not, I'm sorry to have posted in the wrong subreddit, and thank you for potentially reading my post.\n\nBasically, the title summarizes it pretty well. I am 22 years old, having been born and raised in Germany to an American father and German mother. I am fairly certain I did not automatically obtain citizenship at birth due to my dad not meeting the residency requirements (5 years in total LIVING in the US, with two of the years being completed after the 14th birthday). He never filed a CRBA, or form N600K. Still, he is a US citizen, having and having kept ONLY the US Citizenship (despite living in Germany for close to 50 years).\n\nMy Grandfather, however, would very much be meeting the requirements (He lived in the USA for about 40 years before my Dad was born, and about 5 years just after), and as stated in the Instructions for form N600K, this would also count, given I can prove my Dads dependency on my Grandpa (which I also can). The problem here is that I am now over 18 years of age, which means form N600K doesn't apply to me anymore. Another important factor would be that my grandpa was in the Air Force for a pretty long time, with this also being the reason for him moving to Germany 5 years after adopting my Dad. We have multiple files documenting his service and exceptional performance during these years, on North American AND \"foreign\" US soil (\"Foreign\" as in the barracks here in Germany).\n\nI am currently residing in Germany, but I'm very much planning on moving to the US sooner than later. I believe I do have everything it should take to be granted citizenship / prove I am eligible for citizenship, my only REAL issue is the fact that theres no Form to fill out as I am, as stated before, resident in Germany, over the Age of 18 and have never lived in the USA myself.\n\nMy question now is the following: What are my options? How, where, and to whom can I prove my eligibility for citizenship based on the factors I just listed? Are there any forms I can fill out (except for N-600, N-600K, and DS-2029, as I don't meet the eligibility requirements for these)? Are there any resources for cases as mine? Sadly, the two USCIS agents I talked to weren't of much help, which is why I am asking here. If you made it this far, I appreciate you taking time to read through this, and if you have any answers/tips/ideas where to start, I'd greatly appreciate you telling me either through the comments or PMs. If you need any more information to be able to help me, please let me know as well.\n\nThank you very much and have a great rest of your day,\n\nJake",

If this information was given out freely, then more people would come and ruin the arbitrage you committed to earlier than they did.\n\nSo people don’t share information freely. Instead they trade and parcel it out like favors, or guard it so they can feel better about themselves in comparison to you.\n\nHas anyone else ever gotten this sense too?

However, I did make a black and white photocopy of the hospital birth certificate on both sides just before I handed it over.\n\nWill my photocopy count as a true copy, or do I need special certifications from the Civil Registry that received the original?",

I will probably be asking several questions about this process over the coming days.\n\nFor background, I am an American living in Mexico with my Mexican wife and our two-month-old baby son. Even though I've been in Mexico since I graduated from the university 11 years ago, I do meet the criteria to pass my citizenship on to him.\n\nSpecifically, since I am a US citizen who was married to a non-citizen during the birth of my son, I need to prove five years' presence in the US before his birth, at least two of which were after I was 14.\n\nTo do this, I have ordered my high school and college transcripts. The former covers the period from September 2002 to June 2006, and the latter from September 2006 to June 2011.\n\nNow, as far as I can tell, even the strictest reading of these transcripts alone should put me within the five years I need. However, I am curious, will they accept these transcripts as covering 3 years and 9 months for high school and 4 years and 9 months for college, or will they hair-splittingly attempt to deduct winter and summer breaks that those records technically don't account for? Or will they be as generous as to accept them as covering a full 8 years and 9 months?\n\nI should note that I lived in the US for the first 24 years of my life, so I definitely meet the requirement. I just want to know how many records I need to purchase and how much I need to bother my dad and brother back home before they visit me, my wife, and their new grandson/nephew for Christmas.\n\nAny insight is appreciated.

I moved with my wife and my one-year-old son.\n\nFor us, safety is a must. If all our basics are covered, we do not care about luxuries, status, and even money.\n\nWhen they offered me the role, of course, we discussed the safety situation in Mexico. They told me that it is mainly a stereotypical view of the world/movies and that the area where I will live (one of the nicest in Mexico) is safe and okay.\n\nThe first months we lived here were all relative okay, despite being extra cautious as pedestrians because they have no pedestrian culture compared to other countries. \n\nLast month, walking in our neighbourhood, we experienced the execution of a person; luckily, a few minutes after it happened, but we saw the body meters from us. My wife is very unhappy here.\n\nWith the experience of living on different continents, we never experienced or been close to something like this. Of course, we were shocked, and when we googled it, we noticed that this situation is more regular than rare. It was another major reason for us to want to leave the country as soon as possible. \n\nThe dilemma. Should we try to stay here for at least a year and then ask my company to find me a role in another country (given the reasons we are not mentally okay here)? Or should I don't make my life and my wife's life miserable any extra month and ask my company to relocate? I would love to leave in the coming months if you asked me, but I'm afraid that this can backfire and crush my career and relationship with my employer.\n\nWhat would you do in our case?",

The downside of going home is that I probably have to live with my parents for another 6/9 months while I buy my own apartment somewhere in the outskirts of the island (tbh minor inconvenience) but just going back to a local lifestyle.\n\nThere are several factors that I am looking at to weigh this\n\nCAREER - I have similar offers in China and Singapore (home) in terms of money, career progression is settled but I am still hesitating and feel inclined to reject the China offer because I'm not sure if I can survive longer here.. 2 years is possible but 3/4 years seems tough and my GF bottomline is 3/4 years.\n\nPERSONAL - I feel bad that I am unable to be there for my parents - for example, my mum has to go for operation herself because there's no one else who can bring her and it made me want to just pack up and go home\n\nRELATIONSHIP - The fact that I don't know if I can survive another 3/4 years makes me feel like things will fall apart after 1/2 years and rather than let that happen then, I should let it happen now and quickly move on with life\n\nI'm not sure what or how I should evaluate this and i've been bothered by this for a long time and hope to get some advice on how to see this or change my thinking. I guess, if I were single - the decision would be much easier because I wouldn't have any baggage - except for sacrificing the lifestyle but at the same time maybe I'm also looking at life back home through rose-tinted glasses?",

Maybe I should see if Mexico is hiring, then tear up my passport if that doesn't work and join the migration? Okay the last part was kidding, kindof.",

        "selftext": "Come March I will have to move out of my home in NYC (this is happening regardless of what I do). My plan prior to the pandemic was always to try a nomadic lifestyle. Obviously the pandemic has complicated that.\n\nMy plan tentatively is to join a close friend in Hawaii come March and stay for 2 months (maybe 1). After that, I'd like to join a friend in Mexico City and live there for 6 months. From there, I'll figure out what's next. I am staying in these places for those durations as it aligns with when I'll have a friend/place to stay with. \n\nI am immensely conflicted. I have been extremely vigilant about the coronavirus. I have not eaten out once. I have only met 1 or 2 friends outside socially distanced with masks at any given time. I have definitely not gone to any parties. Not out of concern for personal safety but because I feel it's a duty we all bear to sacrifice for the greater good. \n\nThis is my inherent conflict. Is it ethically right or justifiable to embark on this more nomadic lifestyle where I expect to stay at a place 3-6 months and move on? \n\nOn one hand, I justify it to myself by saying I will only *move* to a location. I won't engage in reckless or selfish behavior. I will be the best visitor I can be until a vaccine. Many people have moved since the pandemic and I would be one of them. I don't fault them for making a move and find it rather reasonable. Moreover, we may have a vaccine by the time my 6 month stint in Mexico is over. Which would mitigate any concerns on my end of my next few moves.\n\nOn the other, nomadic lifestyles are inherently different. While I will practice all precaution while I am settled/living in a place, I aim to be moving around every 3-6 months with the exception of the initial 1-2 month stint in Hawaii. There's no guarantee that there will be a vaccine and that sort of frequent movement is not helpful. And if I ever do get sick, I could be a disproportionate burden to a country like Mexico that is less equipped financially to deal with a pandemic.\n\nWould love your thoughts on the situation. Excuse me if I post this on a few other subreddits. Would like to consider the widest variety of viewpoints I can. Thank you for reading.\n\nTl;dr: Want to become a \"nomad\" come March. Struggling with the ethical ramifications of it.",

        "selftext": "I am a Mexican living in the US, but my mother is an American citizen living in Mexico and I want to help her vote from abroad. She was born and lived in New York until she and her family moved to Mexico when she was 16, nearly 50 years ago. In 2016, I helped her vote for the first time in her life. She was so incredibly excited that she cried! So I refrained from telling her what I knew: that because of the electoral college and given that she is from a solid blue state, her vote didn't matter one bit. This year I want to help not only vote, but making her vote count. I would like her to vote in a battleground state. From what I remember four years ago, she didn't have to submit any proof that she resided in New York, she just provided the address where she lived 50 years ago. Is it possible for her to just Google an address in a battleground state and request a ballot there? Can she get in any trouble for this?\n\nI know that this is bending the rules and I am not set on doing it because I am usually a by the book person. I'm also open to hearing what you think about the ethics of this.\n\nEDIT: Removed political commentary.\n\nEDIT2: And it's done! She registered and requested her ballot from the NY county where she last lived before leaving the US. No voter fraud committed :)  If any American expat here hasn't yet requested their ballot I highly recommend votefromabroad.org",
